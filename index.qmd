# Why R?

-   In our MSBA program, we teach R because it is a powerful, flexible tool widely used in business analytics for data analysis and visualization. R allows students to apply theoretical concepts to real-world datasets, enhancing their understanding through hands-on practice. Its rich ecosystem of packages, like ggplot2 for visualization and dplyr for data manipulation, makes it ideal for tackling the types of problems analysts face in the field. Additionally, R promotes reproducibility and collaboration through features like R Markdown and RStudio Projects, which align with industry standards. By learning R, students not only gain valuable technical skills but also build a strong foundation for advanced analytics and decision-making in their careers.

-   R is a very sophisticated statistical software that allows you to enter commands one-at-a-time, or write scripts using the R language.

-   Easily installed, state-of-the-art, and it is free and open source and supported by a well-established R Community.

-   R can be used with RStudio, which is a graphical user interface that allows you to do the following:

    -   write, edit, and execute code;
    -   generate, view, and store plots;
    -   manage files, objects and data frames;
    -   integrate with version control systems.

-   R comes with community that helps in the development of R resources.

    -   A package is developed by R users to do one specific thing or a set of related things that could store a collection of functions, data, and code.
    -   A library is the place where the package is located on your computer.

-   A repository is a central location where many developed packages are located and available for download. There are 3 big repositories, but we use Comprehensive R Archive Network, or CRAN, which is R's main repository with over 18,000 packages available.

-   R's community is vast, and you can always seek information from the community to try to help you with a R related issue.
