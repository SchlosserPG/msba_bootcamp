We say an object receives or is assigned the value of the expression on the right.\n\n\nNaming Constants: A Constant contains a single numeric value.\n\n\nThe recommended format for constants is starting with a “k” and then using camel case. (e.g., kStates).\n\n\nNaming Functions: Functions are objects that perform a series of R commands to do something in particular.\n\n\nThe recommended format for Functions is to use Camel case with the first letter capitalized. (e.g., MultiplyByTwo).\n\n\nNaming Variables: A Variable is a measured characteristic of some entity.\n\n\nThe recommended format for variables is to use either the dot case or camel case. e.g., filled.script.month or filledScriptMonth.\nA valid variable name consists of letters, numbers, along with the dot or underline characters.\nA variable name must start with a letter, or the dot when not followed by a number.\nA variable cannot contain spaces.\nVariable names are case sensitive: x is different from X just as Age is different from AGE.\nThe value on the right must be a number, string, an expression, or another variable.\nSome Examples Using Variable Rules:\n\n\nAB.1 &lt;- \"Allowed?\"\n# Does not follow rules - not allowed Try the statement below with no\n# hashtag to see the error message .123 &lt;- 'Allowed?'\nA.A123 &lt;- \"Allowed?\"\nG123AB &lt;- \"Allowed?\"\n# Recommended format for constants\nkStates &lt;- 29\n\n\nDifferent R coders have different preferences, but consistency is key in making sure your code is easy to follow and for others to read. In this course, we will generally use the recommendation in the text which are listed above.\nWe tend to use one letter variable names (i.e., x) for placeholders or for simple functions (like naming a vector).",

    "text": "Built-in Functions\n\nR has thousands of built-in functions including those for summary statistics. Below, we use a few built-in functions with constant numbers. The sqrt(), max(), and min() functions compute the square root of a number, and find the maximum and minimum numbers in a vector.\n\n\nsqrt(100)\n\n[1] 10\n\nmax(100, 200, 300)\n\n[1] 300\n\nmin(100, 200, 300)\n\n[1] 100\n\n\n\nWe can also create variables to use within built-in functions.\nBelow, we create a vector x and use a few built-in functions as examples.\n\nThe sort() function sorts a vector from small to large.\n\n\nx &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 3, 100, -10, 40)  #Creating a Vector x\nsort(x)  #Sorting the Vector x from Small to Large\n\n[1] -10   1   2   3   3  40 100\n\nmax(x)  #Finding Largest Element of Vector x\n\n[1] 100\n\nmin(x)  #Finding Smallest Element of Vector x\n\n[1] -10\n\n\n\n\nBuilt-in Functions: Setting an Argument\n\nThe standard format to a built-in function is functionName(argument)\n\nFor example, the square root function structure is listed as sqrt(x), where x is a numeric or complex vector or array.\n\n\n\n# Here, we are setting a required argument x to a value of 100. When\n# a value is set, it turns it to a parameter of the function.\nsqrt(x = 100)\n\n[1] 10\n\n# Because there is only one argument and it is required, we can\n# eliminate its name x= from our function call. This is discussed\n# below.\nsqrt(100)\n\n[1] 10\n\n\n\nThere is a little variety in how we can write functions to get the same results.\nA parameter is what a function can take as input. It is a placeholder and hence does not have a concrete value. An argument is a value passed during function invocation.\nThere are some default values set up in R in which arguments have already been set.\nThere are a few functions with no parameters like Sys.time() which produces the date and time. If you are not sure how many parameters a function has, you should look it up in the help.\n\n\n\nDefault Values\n\nThere are many default values set up in R in which arguments have already been set to a particular value or field.\nDefault values have been set when you see the = value in the instructions. If we don’t want to change it, we don’t need to include it in our function call.\nWhen only one argument is required, the argument is usually not set to have a default value.\n\n\n\nBuilt-in Functions: Using More than One Argument\n\nFor functions with more than one parameter, we must determine what arguments we want to include, and whether a default value was set and if we want to change it. Default values have been set when you see the = value in the instructions. If we don’t want to change it, we don’t need to include it in our function call.\n\nFor example, the default S3 method for the seq() function is listed as the following: seq(from = 1, to = 1, by = ((to - from)/(length.out - 1)),length.out = NULL, along.with = NULL, …)\nDefault values have been set on each parameter, but we can change some of them to get a meaningful result.\nFor example, we set the from, to, and by parameter to get a sequence from 0 to 30 in increments of 5.\n\n\n\n# We can use the following code.\nseq(from = 0, to = 30, by = 5)\n\n[1]  0  5 10 15 20 25 30\n\n\n\nWe can simplify this function call even further:\n\nIf we use the same order of parameters as the instructions, we can eliminate the argument= from the function.\nSince we do list the values to the arguments in same order as the function is defined, we can eliminate the from=, to=, and by= to simplify the statement.\n\n\n# Equivalent statement as above\nseq(0, 30, 5)\n\n[1]  0  5 10 15 20 25 30\n\n\nIf you leave off the by parameter, it defaults at 1.\n\n\n# Leaving by= to default value of 1\nseq(0, 30)\n\n [1]  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24\n[26] 25 26 27 28 29 30\n\n\n\nThere can be a little hurdle deciding when you need the argument value in the function call. The general rule is that if you don’t know, include it. If it makes more sense to you to include it, include it.\n\n\n\nTips on Arguments\n\nAlways look up a built-in function to see the arguments you can use.\nArguments are always named when you define a function.\nWhen you call a function, you do not have to specify the name of the argument.\nArguments have default values, which is used if you do not specify a value for that argument yourself.\nAn argument list comprises of comma-separated values that contain the various formal arguments.\nDefault arguments are specified as follows: parameter = expression\n\n\ny &lt;- 10:20\nsort(y)\n\n [1] 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n\nsort(y, decreasing = FALSE)\n\n [1] 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n\n\n\n\nInstall Packages\n\nIn R, a package is a collection of functions, data, and documentation bundled together to perform specific tasks. Packages extend the capabilities of base R by providing tools for specialized analyses, graphics, data manipulation, machine learning, and much more.\n\nOption 1: Run install.packages(“tidyverse”) in the Console\nOption 2: Go to: Tools → Install Packages\n\nType the package name in the dialog box.\nMake sure Repository (CRAN) is selected.\nClick Install.\n\n\nOnce installed, you can load the package with: library(tidyverse).\nYou only need to install once, but you should load with library() every time you use it in a new session.\n\n\n\nAccessing Functions from Libraries\n\nTo use functions from a package like dplyr, you can either:\n\nLoad the library\n\n\ndata(mtcars)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nfunctionexample &lt;- filter(mtcars, mpg &gt; 20)\n\n\nUse the function explicitly, where explicit use of libraries means calling a function by prefixing it with the package name and ::\n\n\n\nfunctionexample &lt;- dplyr::filter(mtcars, mpg &gt; 20)\n\n\nIn other words, we use :: when you only need one function or want to avoid loading the full package.\n\n\n\nNote on Libraries\n\nSome libraries are part of other global libraries:\n\ndplyr and ggplot2 are part of tidyverse, there is actually no need to activate dplyr or ggplot2 if tidyverse is active, however, sometimes it helps when conflicts are present.\nAn example of a conflict is the use of a select function which shows up in both the dplyr and MASS package. If both libraries are active, R does not know which to use.\ntidyverse has many libraries included in it. You can see an list in the console message after you load the library.",

    "text": "Entering and Loading Data\n\nCreating a Vector\n\nA vector is the simplest type of data structure in R.\n\nA vector is a set of data elements that are saved together as the same type.\nWe have many ways to create vectors with some examples below.\n\nUse c() function, which is a generic function which combines its arguments into a vector or list.\n\n\nc(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  #Print a Vector 1:5\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\n\nIf numbers are aligned, can use the “:“ symbol to include numbers and all in between. This is considered an array.\n\n\n1:5  #Print a Vector 1:5\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\n\nUse seq() function to make a vector given a sequence.\n\n\nseq(from = 0, to = 30, by = 5)  #Creates a sequence vector from 0 to 30 in increments on 5 \n\n[1]  0  5 10 15 20 25 30\n\n\n\nUse rep() function to repeat the elements of a vector.\n\n\nrep(x = 1:3, times = 4)  #Repeat the elements of the vector 4 times\n\n [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3\n\nrep(x = 1:3, each = 3)  #Repeat the elements of a vector 3 times each\n\n[1] 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3\n\n\n\n\nCreating a Matrix\n\nA matrix is another type of object like a vector or a list.\n\nA matrix has a rectangular format with rows and columns.\nA matrix uses matrix() function\nYou can include the byrow = argument to tell the function whether to fill across or down first.\nYou can also include the dimnames() function in addition to the matrix() to assign names to rows and columns.\n\nUsing matrix() function, we can create a matrix with 3 rows and 3 columns as shown below.\n\nTake note how the matrix fills in the new data.\n\n\n# Creating a Variable X that has 9 Values.\nx &lt;- 1:9\n# Setting the matrix.\nmatrix(x, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    4    7\n[2,]    2    5    8\n[3,]    3    6    9\n\n# Note – we do not need to name the arguments because we go in the\n# correct order.

In this case below both are added to our matrix m.\n\n\ndimnames(x = m) &lt;- list(c(\"2020\", \"2021\", \"2022\"), c(\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\"))\nm  #Printing the matrix in the console\n\n     low medium high\n2020   1      2    3\n2021   4      5    6\n2022   7      8    9\n\n\n\nYou try to make a matrix of 25 items, or a 5 by 5, and fill the matrix across the row and assign the matrix to the name m2.\nYou should get the answer below.\n\n\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]\n[1,]    1    2    3    4    5\n[2,]    6    7    8    9   10\n[3,]   11   12   13   14   15\n[4,]   16   17   18   19   20\n[5,]   21   22   23   24   25\n\n\n\n\nCbind and Rbind\n\nThe rbind() and cbind() functions in R are used to combine vectors, matrices, or data frames by rows (rbind) or columns (cbind), respectively, to form a larger matrix or data frame.\n\ncbind() joins vectors side by side (as columns).\nrbind() joins vectors on top of each other (as rows).\nBoth functions require vectors of equal length.\n\n\n# Vectors to use\na &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)\nb &lt;- c(4, 5, 6)\n\n# Combine as columns (column-bind)\nmatrix_cbind &lt;- cbind(a, b)\nmatrix_cbind\n\n     a b\n[1,] 1 4\n[2,] 2 5\n[3,] 3 6\n\n# Combine as rows (row-bind)\nmatrix_rbind &lt;- rbind(a, b)\nmatrix_rbind\n\n  [,1] [,2] [,3]\na    1    2    3\nb    4    5    6\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferences between Data Frames and Matrices\n\nIn a data frame the columns contain different types of data, but in a matrix all the elements are the same type of data. A matrix is usually numbers.\nA matrix can be looked at as a vector with additional methods or dimensions, while a data frame is a list.\n\n\n\n\nCreating a Data Frame\n\nA data frame is a table or a two-dimensional array-like structure in which each column contains values of one variable and each row contains one set of values from each column. In a data frame the rows are observations and columns are variables.\n\nData frames are generic data objects to store tabular data.\nThe column names should be non-empty.\nThe row names should be unique.\nThe data stored in a data frame can be of numeric, factor or character type.\nEach column should contain same number of data items.\nCombing vectors into a data frame using the data.frame() function\n\nBelow, we can create vectors for state, year enacted, personal oz limit medical marijuana.\n\n\nstate &lt;- c(\"Alaska\", \"Arizona\", \"Arkansas\")\nyear.legal &lt;- c(1998, 2010, 2016)\nounce.lim &lt;- c(1, 2.5, 3)\n\n\nThen, we can combine the 3 vectors into a data frame and name the data frame pot.legal.\n\n\npot.legal &lt;- data.frame(state, year.legal, ounce.lim)\n\n\nNext, check your global environment to confirm data frame was created.\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Environment\n\n\n\n\nImporting a Data Frame into R\n\nWhen importing data from outside sources, you can do the following:\n\n\nYou can import data from an R package using data() function.\nYou can also link directly to a file on the web.\nYou can import data through from your computer through common file extensions:\n\n.csv: comma separated values;\n.txt: text file;\n.xls or .xlsx: Excel file;\n.sav: SPSS file;\n.sasb7dat: SAS file;\n.xpt: SAS transfer file;\n.dta: Stata file.\n\n\n\nEach different file type requires a unique function to read in the file. With all the variety in file types, it is best to look it up in the R Community to help.\n\n\nUse data() function\n\nAll we need is the data() function to read in a data set that is part of R. R has many built in libraries now, so there are many data sets we can use for testing and learning statistics in R.\n\n\n# The mtcars data set is part of R, so no new package needs to be\n# downloaded.\ndata(\"mtcars\")\n\n\nLoad a data frame from a unique package in R.\n\nThere are also a lot of packages that house data sets. It is fairly easy to make a package that contains data and load it into CRAN. These packages need to be installed into your R one time. Then, each time you open R, you need to reload the library using the library() function.\nWhen your run the install.packages() function, do not include the # symbol. Then, after you run it one time, comment it out. There is no need to run this code a second time unless something happens to your RStudio.\n\n\n# install.packages('MASS') #only need to install package one time in\n# R\nlibrary(MASS)\n\n\n\ndata(\"Insurance\")\nhead(Insurance)\n\n  District  Group   Age Holders Claims\n1        1    &lt;1l   &lt;25     197     38\n2        1    &lt;1l 25-29     264     35\n3        1    &lt;1l 30-35     246     20\n4        1    &lt;1l   &gt;35    1680    156\n5        1 1-1.5l   &lt;25     284     63\n6        1 1-1.5l 25-29     536     84\n\n\n\n\nAccessing Variables\n\nYou can directly access a variable from a dataset using the $ symbol followed by the variable name.\nThe $ symbol facilitates data manipulation operations by allowing easy access to variables for calculations, transformations, or other analyses. For example:\n\n\nhead(Insurance$Claims)  #lists the first 6 Claims in the Insurance dataset.\n\n[1]  38  35  20 156  63  84\n\nsd(Insurance$Claims)  #provides the standard deviation of all Claims in the Insurance dataset.\n\n[1] 71.1624",

Therefore, both as.data.frame() and data.frame() are used to convert or create data frames in R.\nas.data.frame() coerces an existing object (such as a list, matrix, or vector) into a data frame. Data.frame is used to create a new data frame from individual vectors or lists.\nas.data.frame() accepts a wider variety of inputs (like lists, matrices, and vectors), while data.frame() directly accepts vectors and lists to construct the data frame.\n\n\nTransposedData &lt;- as.data.frame(TransposedData)\nTransposedData\n\n  frequencies proportions cumulfreq cumulproportions\nA           5         0.5         5              0.5\nB           3         0.3         8              0.8\nC           2         0.2        10              1.0",

    "text": "Summarizing Quantitative Data\n\nDefining and Calculating Central Tendency\n\nThe term central location refers to how numerical data tend to cluster around some middle or central value.\nMeasures of central location attempt to find a typical or central value that describes a variable.\nWhy frequency distributions do not work for numeric variables:\n\nNumeric variables measured on a continuum.\nInstead, we calculate descriptive statistics including central tendency and spread of the values for a numeric variable.\n\nWe will examine the three mostly widely used measures of central location: mean, median and mode.\nThen we discuss a percentile: a measure of relative position.\n\n\nUsing the Mean\n\nThe arithmetic mean or simply the mean is a primary measure of central location. It is often referred to as the average. Simply add up all the observations and divide by the number of observations.\nThe numerator (top of the fraction) is the sum (sigma) of all the values of x from the first value (i = 1) to the last value (n) divided by the number of values (n).\n\\(m_x = (\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i})/n\\)\nConsider the salaries of employees at a company: \nWe can use the mean() command to calculate the mean in R.\n\n\n# Create Vector of Salaries\nsalaries &lt;- c(40000, 40000, 65000, 90000, 145000, 150000, 550000)\n# Calculate the mean using the mean() command\nmean(salaries)\n\n[1] 154285.7\n\n\n\nNote that due to at least one outlier this mean does not reflect the typical salary - more on that later.\nIf we edit our vector to include NAs, we have to account for this. This is a common way to handle NAs in functions that do not allow for them.\n\n\nsalaries2 &lt;- c(40000, 40000, 65000, 90000, 145000, 150000, 550000, NA,\n    NA)\n# Calculate the mean using the mean() command Notice that it does not\n# work\nmean(salaries2)\n\n[1] NA\n\n# Add in na.rm parameter to get it to produce the mean with no NAs.\nmean(salaries2, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 154285.7\n\n\n\nNote that there are other types of means like the weighted mean or the geometric mean.\n\nThe weighted mean uses weights to determine the importance of each data point of a variable. It is calculated by \\(\\bar{x}_w = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}\\), where are the weights associated to the values.\nAn example is below.\n\n\nvalues &lt;- c(4, 7, 10, 5, 6)\nweights &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nweighted_mean &lt;- weighted.mean(values, weights)\nweighted_mean\n\n[1] 6.533333\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Median\n\nThe median is another measure of central location that is not affected by outliers.\nWhen the data are arranged in ascending order, the median is:\n\nThe middle value if the number of observations is odd, or\nThe average of the two middle values if the number of observations is even.\n\nConsider the sorted salaries of employees presented earlier which contains an odd number of observations.\n\nOn the same salaries vector created above, use median() command to calculate the median in R.\n\n\n# Calculate the median using the median() command\nmedian(salaries)\n\n[1] 90000\n\n\n\nNow compare to the mean and note the large difference in numbers signifying that at least one outlier is most likely present.\nSpecifically, if the mean and median are different, it is likely the variable is skewed and contains outliers.\n\n\nmean(salaries)\n\n[1] 154285.7\n\n\n\nFor another example, consider the sorted data below that contains an even number of values.\n\n\nGrowthFund &lt;- c(-38.32, 1.71, 3.17, 5.99, 12.56, 13.47, 16.89, 16.96, 32.16,\n    36.29)\n\n\nWhen data contains an even number of values, the median is the average of the 2 sorted middle numbers (12.56 and 13.47).\n\n\nmedian(GrowthFund)\n\n[1] 13.015\n\n(12.56 + 13.47)/2\n\n[1] 13.015\n\n# The mean is still the average\nmean(GrowthFund)\n\n[1] 10.088\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Mode\n\nThe mode is another measure of central location.\nThe mode is the most frequently occurring value in a data set.\nThe mode is useful in summarizing categorical data but can also be used to summarize quantitative data.\nA data set can have no mode, one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal) or many modes (multimodal).\nThe mode is less useful when there are more than three modes.\n\n\n\nExample of Function with Salary Variable\n\nWhile this is a small vector, when working with a large dataset and a function like sort(x = table(salaries), decreasing = TRUE), appending [1:5] is a way to focus on the top results after the frequencies have been computed and sorted. Specifically, table(salaries) calculates the frequency of each unique salary, sort(…, decreasing = TRUE) orders these frequencies from highest to lowest, and [1:5] selects the first five entries in the sorted list. This is useful when the dataset contains many unique values, as it allows you to quickly identify and extract the top 5 most frequent salaries, providing a concise summary without being overwhelmed by the full distribution.\nConsider the salary of employees presented earlier. 40,000 appears 2 times and is the mode because that occurs most often.\n\n\n# Try this command with and without it.\nsort(x = table(salaries), decreasing = TRUE)[1:5]\n\nsalaries\n 40000  65000  90000 145000 150000 \n     2      1      1      1      1 \n\n\n\n\nFinding No Mode\n\nLook at the sort(table()) commands with the GrowthFund Vector we made earlier.\nI added a 1:5 in square brackets at the end of the statement to produce the 3 highest frequencies found in the vector.\n\n\nsort(table(GrowthFund), decreasing = TRUE)[1:5]\n\nGrowthFund\n-38.32   1.71   3.17   5.99  12.56 \n     1      1      1      1      1 \n\n\n\nEven if you use this command, you still need to evaluate the data more systematically to verify the mode. If the highest frequency of the sorted table is 1, then there is no mode.",

    "text": "Defining and Calculating Spread\n\nSpread is a measure of distance values are from the central value.\nEach measure of central tendency has one or more corresponding measures of spread.\nMean: use variance or standard deviation to measure spread.\n\nskewness and kurtosis help measure spread as well.\n\nMedian: use range or interquartile range (IQR) to measure spread.\nMode: use the index of qualitative variation to measure spread.\n\nNot formally testing here with a function.\n\n\n\nSpread to Report with the Mean\n\nEvaluating Skewness\n\nSkewness is a measure of the extent to which a distribution is skewed.\nCan evaluate skewness visually with histogram.\n\nA histogram is a visual representation of a frequency or a relative frequency distribution.\nBar height represents the respective class frequency (or relative frequency).\nBar width represents the class width.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluating Skewness Visually\n\n\n\n\nSkewed Distributions: Median Not Same as Mean\n\nSometimes, a histogram is difficult to tell if skewness is present or if the data is relatively normal or symmetric.\nIf Mean is less than Median and Mode, then the variable is Left-Skewed.\nIf the Mean is greater than the Median and Mode, then the variable is Right-Skewed.\nIf the Mean is about equal to the Median and Mode, then the variable has a symmetric distribution.\nIn R, we can easily look at mean and median with the summary() command.\n\n\n\n\nEvaluating Skewness Using Mean and Median\n\n\n\nMean is great when data are normally distributed (data is not skewed).\nMean is not a good representation of skewed data where outliers are present.\n\nAdding together a set of values that includes a few very large or very small values like those on the far left of a left-skewed distribution or the far right of the right-skewed distribution will result in a large or small total value in the numerator of Equation and therefore the mean will be a large or small value relative to the actual middle of the data.\n\nThere are a number of ways to check for skewness, two functions are below.The skewness() function from the e1071 package and the skew() function from the semTools package both measure skewness, but they differ slightly in how they scale the result.\nBy default, e1071::skewness() uses a sample-based formula (dividing by \\(n\\)). In contrast, semTools::skew() uses Mardia’s definition and is more commonly applied in structural equation modeling contexts.\nAs a result, the values may differ slightly, especially for small samples or skewed distributions. Both are valid but should be used consistently depending on the analytical context.\n\n\n\nUsing skewness command from e1071\n\nA standard calculation of skewness using the mean is based on the third standardized moment of a distribution. The formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Skewness} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{x_i - \\bar{x}}{s} \\right)^3\n\\] * where \\(x_i\\) = each observation * \\(\\bar{x}\\) = sample mean * \\(s\\) = sample standard deviation * \\(n\\) = sample size * This formula measures the asymmetry of the distribution: + Positive skew (right-skewed): longer tail on the right + Negative skew (left-skewed): longer tail on the left + Zero skew: symmetric distribution\n\ne1071::skewness(salaries)\n\n[1] 1.415062\n\n## a positive number indicates a longer tail to the right.\n\n\n\nUsing skew() Command from semTools\n\nWe will use the skew() command is from the semTools package.\nThe install.packages() command is commented out below, but install it one time on your R before commenting it out.\n\n\n# install the semTools package if necessary.\n# install.packages('semTools') Activate the library\nlibrary(semTools)\n\n\nAfter the package is installed and loaded, run the skew() command on the salaries vector made above.\n\n\nskew(salaries)\n\nskew (g1)        se         z         p \n    2.311     0.926     2.496     0.013 \n\n\n\n\nInterpreting the skew() Command Results\n\nse = standard error\nz = skew/se\nIf the sample size is small (n &lt; 50), z values outside the –2 to 2 range are a problem.\nIf the sample size is between 50 and 300, z values outside the –3.29 to 3.29 range are a problem.\nFor large samples (n &gt; 300), using a visual is recommended over the statistics, but generally z values outside the range of –7 to 7 can be considered problematic.\nSalary: Our sample size was small, &lt;50, so the z value of 2.496 in regards to the salary vector indicates there is a problem with skewness.\nGrowthFund: We can check the skew of GrowthFund.\n\n\nskew(GrowthFund)\n\nskew (g1)        se         z         p \n   -1.381     0.775    -1.783     0.075 \n\n\n\nGrowthFund was also considered a small sample size, so the same -2/2 thresholds are used. Here, our z value is -1.78250137, which is in normal range. This indicates there is no problem with skewness.\n\n\n\n\nHistograms\n\nA histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of numerical data.\nIt consists of a series of contiguous rectangles, or bars, where the area of each bar corresponds to the frequency of observations within a particular range or bin of values.\nThe x-axis typically represents the range of values being measured, while the y-axis represents the frequency or count of observations falling within each range.\nHistograms are commonly used in statistics and data analysis to visualize the distribution of a dataset and identify patterns or trends.\nThey are particularly useful for understanding the central tendency, variability, and shape of the data distribution - this includes our observation of skewness.\nWorks much better with larger datsets.\n\n\nCommands to Make a Histogram\n\nhist() command in base R.\ngeom_histogram() command in ggplot2 package.\na hist using the GrowthFund dataset does not look that great because its sample size is so small.\n\n\nhist(GrowthFund)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhist vs geom_histogram\n\nIn R, hist() and geom_histogram() are both used to create histograms, but they belong to different packages and have slightly different functionalities.\n\n\n# Making an appropriate data.frame to use the hist() command\nHousePrice &lt;- c(430, 520, 460, 475, 670, 521, 670, 417, 533, 525, 538,\n    370, 530, 525, 430, 330, 575, 555, 521, 350, 399, 560, 440, 425, 669,\n    660, 702, 540, 460, 588, 445, 412, 735, 537, 630, 430)\nHousePrice &lt;- data.frame(HousePrice)\n\n\nhist(): This function is from the base R graphics package and is used to create histograms. It provides a simple way to visualize the distribution of a single variable.\n\n\n# Using base R to create the histogram.\nhist(HousePrice$HousePrice, breaks = 5, main = \"A Histogram\", xlab = \"House Prices (in $1,000s)\",\n    col = \"yellow\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\ngeom_histogram(): This function is from the ggplot2 package, which is part of the tidyverse. It is used to create histograms as part of a more flexible and powerful plotting system.\n\n\n# Using geom_histogram() command to create the histogram.\nggplot(HousePrice, aes(x = HousePrice)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 100,\n    boundary = 300, color = \"black\", fill = \"yellow\") + labs(title = \"A Histogram\",\n    x = \"House Prices (in $1,000s)\", y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could add more parameters here to make the 2 histograms look identical, but this configuration of parameters is very close. Take note that there are a lot more parameters you can add to the geom_histogram() command than you can with base R to make it look more professional. Be sure to look them up and also check with the notes in the book, which focuses on geom_histogram instead of hist().\nVariance is a measure of spread for numeric variables that is essentially the average of the squared differences between each observation value on some variable and the mean for that variable with population variance. \\[Population Var(X) = \\sigma^2 = \\sum{(x_i-\\mu)^2}/N\\] \\[Sample Var(x) = s^2 = \\sum{(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}/(n-1)\\]\nStandard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n\nUse var() command and sd() command to calculate sample variance and sample standard deviation.\n\n\n\n## Calculated from Small Sample\nx &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nsum((x - mean(x))^2/(5 - 1))\n\n[1] 2.5\n\nvar(x)\n\n[1] 2.5\n\nsqrt(var(x))\n\n[1] 1.581139\n\nsd(x)\n\n[1] 1.581139\n\nsd(HousePrice$HousePrice)  #102.6059\n\n[1] 102.6059\n\nvar(HousePrice$HousePrice)  #10527.97\n\n[1] 10527.97\n\nskew(HousePrice$HousePrice)  #normal\n\nskew (g1)        se         z         p \n    0.317     0.408     0.777     0.437 \n\n\nLooking at Spread for a Larger Dataset\n\n\ncustomers &lt;- read.csv(\"data/customers.csv\")\nsummary(customers$Spending, na.rm = TRUE)  #mean and median\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Positive values will be indicative to a leptokurtic distribution and negative will indicate a platykurtic distribution. To see if kurtosis (leptokurtic or platykurtic) is significant, we confirm them by first evaluating the z-score to see if the variable is normal or not. The same cutoff values from skew also apply for the z for small, medium, and large sample sizes in kurtosis. These are the same basic rules for the rules in judging skewness.\n\n\n\n\nEvaluate Kurtosis\n\n\n\nThe rules of determining problematic distributions with regards to kurtosis are below.\n\nIf the sample size is small (n &lt; 50), z values outside the –2 to 2 range are a problem.\nIf the sample size is between 50 and 300, z values outside the –3.29 to 3.29 range are a problem.\nFor large samples (n &gt; 300), using a visual is recommended over the statistics, but generally z values outside the range of –7 to 7 can be considered problematic.\nIf kurtosis is found, then evaluate the excess kur score to see if it is positive or negative to determine whether it is leptokurtic or platykurtic.\n\n\n\n# z-value is 3.0398, which is &gt; 2 indicating leptokurtic Small sample\n# size: range is -2 to 2\nkurtosis(salaries)\n\nExcess Kur (g2)              se               z               p \n          5.629           1.852           3.040           0.002 \n\n# z-value is 2.20528007, which is &gt; 2 indicating leptokurtic Small\n# sample size: range is -2 to 2\nkurtosis(GrowthFund)\n\nExcess Kur (g2)              se               z               p \n          3.416           1.549           2.205           0.027 \n\n# Small sample size: range is -2 to 2 Skewness and kurtosis are both\n# in range.\nskew(HousePrice$HousePrice)  #normal\n\nskew (g1)        se         z         p \n    0.317     0.408     0.777     0.437 \n\nkurtosis(HousePrice$HousePrice)  #normal\n\nExcess Kur (g2)              se               z               p \n         -0.540           0.816          -0.661           0.508 \n\n\n\nLet’s do a few more examples using the customers dataset.\n\n\n# Noted sample size at 200 observations or a medium sample size.\n# Using threshold –3.29 to 3.29 to assess normality.\n\n#-3.4245446445 is below -3.29 so kurtosis is present\n# Negative kurtosis value indicates platykurtic\nkurtosis(customers$Spending)\n\nExcess Kur (g2)              se               z               p \n         -1.186           0.346          -3.425           0.001 \n\ngeom_histogram(binwidth = 100, fill = \"pink\", color = \"black\")\n\ngeom_bar: na.rm = FALSE, orientation = NA\nstat_bin: binwidth = 100, bins = NULL, na.rm = FALSE, orientation = NA, pad = FALSE\nposition_stack \n\nsemTools::skew(customers$Spending)  ##normal indicating no skewness\n\nskew (g1)        se         z         p \n   -0.018     0.173    -0.106     0.916 \n\n# Normal: 2.977622119 is in between -3.29 and 3.29\nkurtosis(customers$Income)\n\nExcess Kur (g2)              se               z               p \n          1.031           0.346           2.978           0.003 \n\nggplot(customers, aes(Income)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 10000, fill = \"pink\",\n    color = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsemTools::skew(customers$Income)  #Skewed right\n\nskew (g1)        se         z         p \n    0.874     0.173     5.047     0.000 \n\n#-3.7251961028 is below -3.29 so kurtosis is present\n# Negative kurtosis value indicates platykurtic\nkurtosis(customers$HHSize)\n\nExcess Kur (g2)              se               z               p \n         -1.290           0.346          -3.725           0.000 \n\nggplot(customers, aes(HHSize)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = \"pink\",\n    color = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsemTools::skew(customers$HHSize)  #normal\n\nskew (g1)        se         z         p \n   -0.089     0.173    -0.513     0.608 \n\n# Normal: -0.20056607 is in between -3.29 and 3.29\nkurtosis(customers$Orders)\n\nExcess Kur (g2)              se               z               p \n         -0.069           0.346          -0.201           0.841 \n\ngeom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"pink\", color = \"black\")\n\ngeom_bar: na.rm = FALSE, orientation = NA\nstat_bin: binwidth = 5, bins = NULL, na.rm = FALSE, orientation = NA, pad = FALSE\nposition_stack \n\nsemTools::skew(customers$Orders)  ##skewed right\n\nskew (g1)        se         z         p \n    0.789     0.173     4.553     0.000 \n\n\n\n\n\nSpread to Report with the Median\n\nRange = Maximum Value – Minimum Value.\n\nSimplest measure.\nFocuses on Extreme values.\nUse commands diff(range()) or max() – min().\n\nIQR: Difference between the first and third quartiles.\n\nUse IQR() command or quantile() command.\n\n\nsummary(customers$Spending, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

    "text": "Date data type\n\nThe date data type in R is used to represent calendar dates, allowing for accurate storage and manipulation of time-related data. Dates in R are typically stored as objects of class Date, which internally represent the number of days since January 1, 1970. This format facilitates arithmetic operations, such as calculating differences between dates or adding/subtracting days. Dates can be created and manipulated using functions like as.Date() for converting character strings to date objects, or Sys.Date() for retrieving the current date. Handling dates correctly is essential in time series analysis, scheduling, and any task involving chronological data, as improper formatting or assumptions can lead to errors in analysis.\n\n\n# Convert date info in format 'mm/dd/yyyy' using as.Date\nstrDates &lt;- c(\"01/05/1965\", \"08/16/1975\")\ndates &lt;- as.Date(strDates, \"%m/%d/%Y\") \nstr(dates)\n\n Date[1:2], format: \"1965-01-05\" \"1975-08-16\"\n\n\n\nThe lubridate package provides additional tools for working with dates, such as parsing and extracting components like year, month, and day. This package makes dates a lot easier to work with.\n\n\n# Convert date info in format 'mm/dd/yyyy' using lubridate\nlibrary(lubridate)\nstrDates &lt;- c(\"01/05/1965\", \"08/16/1975\")\ndates &lt;- mdy(strDates) \nstr(dates)\n\n Date[1:2], format: \"1965-01-05\" \"1975-08-16\"\n\n\n\nIf you are only given a year and a month, you can use the ym() command to turn it to a date.

    "text": "Full Examples\n\ngss.2016 Data Cleaning\n\nFirst, because we made some edits to the data set, reread in version a using the read.csv command. This brings the data set back to its original form. It is always a good idea to read the dataset back in when you are unsure about whether you have made a mistake during data preparation that could cause a lack of data integrity.\n\n\n\ngss.2016 &lt;- read.csv(file = \"data/gss2016.csv\") \n\n\nBefore we remove any missing data, we need it to be the correct data type. In this case, grass should be a factor.\n\n\n# We coerced this variable earlier, but the object was called gss.2016. \n#Since we reread in the data set, this needs to be done again. \ngss.2016$grass &lt;- as.factor(gss.2016$grass)\n\n\nThe statement below is an equivalent to the function above, but written with the piping operator. It is overwriting gss.2016 after conducting the coercion to factor.\nWe added the mutate function because we are going to add other data cleaning tasks to this statement.\n\n\ngss.2016 &lt;- gss.2016 %&gt;% mutate(grass = as.factor(grass))\n\n\nPiping to More Functions: Missing Data\n\nIn the code below, the as.factor() command has been moved inside a broader mutate statement (that uses tidyverse library) and piped to it the na_if() command that handles missing data. If you use more than one data manipulation statement, the mutate() command is needed to help organize your code with one mutate() is needed for each major change you are making.\nIn the code below, we created a new object gss.2016.cleaned to help store the cleaned version of the dataset. This helps maintain data integrity because your original dataset is still intact and each time, you rerun the entire chunk, which includes all the changes at one time.\n\n\ngss.2016.cleaned &lt;- gss.2016 %&gt;%\n  #Moved coercion statement into a mutate function to keep code tidy\n  mutate(grass = as.factor(grass)) %&gt;% \n  #Moving DK value to NA for not applicable\n  mutate(grass = na_if(x = grass, y = \"DK\"))\n\n#Check the summary, there should be 110 + 3 = 113 in the NA category \nsummary(object = gss.2016.cleaned)\n\n       grass          age           \n DK       :   0   Length:2867       \n IAP      : 911   Class :character  \n LEGAL    :1126   Mode  :character  \n NOT LEGAL: 717                     \n NA's     : 113                     \n\n\n\n\nDrop Levels\n\nThe droplevels function is part of base R and is used to drop unused levels from factor variables in a data frame. It works by removing any levels from a factor variable that are not present in the data.\nNext, we want to edit our code to convert IAP and DK to NA values and drop levels that have are empty.\n\nNote the Piping operator added to the end of the DK line so you can keep going with new commands editing gss.2016.cleaned.\n\n\ngss.2016.cleaned &lt;- gss.2016 %&gt;% \n  mutate(grass = as.factor(grass)) %&gt;% \n  #Added piping operator\n  mutate(grass = na_if(x = grass, y = \"DK\")) %&gt;%   \n  #Turn to na if value of grass = IAP\n  mutate(grass = na_if(x = grass, y = \"IAP\")) %&gt;% \n  #Drop levels in grass that have no values\n  mutate(grass = droplevels(x = grass))  \n#Check what you just did\nsummary(gss.2016.cleaned) \n\n       grass          age           \n LEGAL    :1126   Length:2867       \n NOT LEGAL: 717   Class :character  \n NA's     :1024   Mode  :character  \n\n\n\n\n\nCoercing to Numeric\n\nNext, we handle a numerical variable, age. Age again has an issue being able to be numerical data type because it has “89 OR OLDER” as a value. Before using the as.numeric() command, we need to recode it. We did this above as a stand-alone statement.\n\n\n\ngss.2016.cleaned &lt;- gss.2016 %&gt;% \n  mutate(grass = as.factor(grass)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(grass = na_if(x = grass, y = \"DK\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(grass = na_if(x = grass, y = \"IAP\")) %&gt;% \n  #Added piping operator \n  mutate(grass = droplevels(x = grass)) %&gt;% \n  #Ensure variable can be coded as numeric and fix if necessary. \n  mutate(age = recode(age, \"89 OR OLDER\" = \"89\")) %&gt;% \n  #Coerce into numeric\n  mutate(age = as.numeric(x = age)) \n\n#Check what you just did\nsummary(gss.2016.cleaned) \n\n       grass           age       \n LEGAL    :1126   Min.   :18.00  \n NOT LEGAL: 717   1st Qu.:34.00  \n NA's     :1024   Median :49.00  \n                  Mean   :49.16  \n                  3rd Qu.:62.00  \n                  Max.   :89.00  \n                  NA's   :10     \n\n\n\nThe recode() command that is part of dplyr is like the ifelse() command that is in base R. There are a lot of ways to recode in R.\nFinally, we want to take our numerical variable, age, and cut it at certain breaks to make categories that can be easily analyzed.\n\nThis also ensures that anyone above 89 is coded correctly in a category instead of as the value 89. This again brings back data integrity.\nLast, we want to recode the age variable into categories. We can use the case_when to do this.\n\n\n\ngss.2016.cleaned &lt;- gss.2016 %&gt;% \n     mutate(grass = as.factor(grass)) %&gt;% \n     mutate(grass = na_if(x = grass, y = \"DK\")) %&gt;% \n     mutate(grass = na_if(x = grass, y = \"IAP\")) %&gt;% \n     mutate(grass = droplevels(x = grass)) %&gt;% \n     mutate(age = recode(age, \"89 OR OLDER\" = \"89\")) %&gt;% \n     #Added piping operator\n     mutate(age = as.numeric(x = age)) %&gt;% \n     #Cut numeric variable into groupings\n     mutate(age.cat = as.factor(case_when(\n          age &lt; 30 ~ \"&lt; 30\",\n          age &gt;= 30 & age &lt;= 59 ~ \"30 - 59\",\n          age &gt;= 60 & age &lt;= 74 ~ \"60 - 74\",\n          age &gt;= 75 ~ \"75+\",\n          TRUE ~ NA_character_  # Safety net for NAs\n     )))\n#Check what you just did\nsummary(gss.2016.cleaned) \n\n       grass           age           age.cat    \n LEGAL    :1126   Min.   :18.00   &lt; 30   : 481  \n NOT LEGAL: 717   1st Qu.:34.00   30 - 59:1517  \n NA's     :1024   Median :49.00   60 - 74: 598  \n                  Mean   :49.16   75+    : 261  \n                  3rd Qu.:62.00   NA's   :  10  \n                  Max.   :89.00                 \n                  NA's   :10                    \n\n\n\n\n\nbrfss Data Cleaning\n\nThe full codebook where this screenshot is taken is brfss_2014_codebook.pdf.\n\n\n\n\nEvaluate CodeBook Before Making Decisions\n\n\n\nbrfss &lt;- read.csv(\"data/brfss.csv\")\nsummary(brfss)\n\n    TRNSGNDR        X_AGEG5YR          X_RACE         X_INCOMG    \n Min.   :1.000    Min.   : 1.000   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :1.000  \n 1st Qu.:4.000    1st Qu.: 5.000   1st Qu.:1.000   1st Qu.:3.000  \n Median :4.000    Median : 8.000   Median :1.000   Median :5.000  \n Mean   :4.059    Mean   : 7.822   Mean   :1.992   Mean   :4.481  \n 3rd Qu.:4.000    3rd Qu.:10.000   3rd Qu.:1.000   3rd Qu.:5.000  \n Max.   :9.000    Max.   :14.000   Max.   :9.000   Max.   :9.000  \n NA's   :310602                    NA's   :94                     \n    X_EDUCAG        HLTHPLN1         HADMAM          X_AGE80     \n Min.   :1.000   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :1.000    Min.   :18.00  \n 1st Qu.:2.000   1st Qu.:1.000   1st Qu.:1.000    1st Qu.:44.00  \n Median :3.000   Median :1.000   Median :1.000    Median :58.00  \n Mean   :2.966   Mean   :1.108   Mean   :1.215    Mean   :55.49  \n 3rd Qu.:4.000   3rd Qu.:1.000   3rd Qu.:1.000    3rd Qu.:69.00  \n Max.   :9.000   Max.   :9.000   Max.   :9.000    Max.   :80.00  \n                                 NA's   :208322                  \n    PHYSHLTH   \n Min.   : 1.0  \n 1st Qu.:20.0  \n Median :88.0  \n Mean   :61.2  \n 3rd Qu.:88.0  \n Max.   :99.0  \n NA's   :4     \n\n\n\nQualitative Variable\n\nTo look at an example, the one below seeks to understand the healthcare issue in reporting gender based on different definitions.

In the codebook, it looks like the data is most applicable to the first 2 categories. The 1-30 days coding and the 88 coding, which means 0 days of physical illness and injury.\n\nUsing cleaned data, we need to prep the variable a little more before getting an accurate plot.\nSpecifically, we need to null out the 77 and 99 values and make sure the 88 coding is set to be 0 for 0 days of illness and injury.\n\n\n\nbrfss.cleaned &lt;- brfss %&gt;% \n  mutate(TRNSGNDR = recode_factor(TRNSGNDR,\n      '1' = 'Male to female',\n      '2' = 'Female to male',\n      '3' = 'Gender non-conforming',\n      '4' = 'Not transgender',\n      '7' = 'Not sure',\n      '9' = 'Refused')) %&gt;%\n  #Turn the 77 values to NA's. \n  mutate(PHYSHLTH = na_if(PHYSHLTH, y = 77)) %&gt;%\n  #Turn the 99 values to NA's. \n  mutate(PHYSHLTH = na_if(PHYSHLTH, y = 99)) %&gt;%\n  #Recode the 88 values to be numeric value of 0. \n  mutate(PHYSHLTH = recode(PHYSHLTH, '88' = 0L))\n\n\nThe histogram showed most people have between 0 and 10 unhealthy days per 30 days.\nNext, evaluate mean, median, and mode for the PHYSHLTH variable after ignoring the blanks.\n\n\nmean(brfss.cleaned$PHYSHLTH, na.rm=TRUE)\n\n[1] 4.224106\n\nmedian(brfss.cleaned$PHYSHLTH, na.rm=TRUE)\n\n[1] 0\n\nnames(x = sort(x = table(brfss.cleaned$PHYSHLTH), decreasing = TRUE))[1]\n\n[1] \"0\"\n\n\n\nWhile the mean is higher at 4.22, the median and most common number is 0.\n\n\n## Spread to Report with the Mean\nvar(brfss.cleaned$PHYSHLTH, na.rm=TRUE)\n\n[1] 77.00419\n\nsd(brfss.cleaned$PHYSHLTH, na.rm=TRUE)\n\n[1] 8.775203\n\n##Spread to Report with Median\nsummary(brfss.cleaned$PHYSHLTH, na.rm=TRUE)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Used the | “or” operator for this filter().\nThe second filter chose people in an age category above category 4 but below category 12, in the age categories 5 through 11.\nThe last filter used the !is.na to choose observations where HADMAM variable was not NA.\n\nNext, we reduce data set to contain only variables used to create table by using the select() command.\nNext, we change all the remaining variables in data set to factors using mutate_all() command. This not only changes the strings to factors, but also changes the numerical variables to factors.\nFinally, we use mutate() commands to change the variable category to something meaningful(from the codebook).\n\nNotice the backslash before the apostrophe in Don’t in the X_INCOMG recode. This is to prevent the .R file from ending the quotations. You could use double quotes around the statement to bypass this, or add the backslash like I did here.\n\n\nbrfss_small &lt;- brfss.cleaned %&gt;%\n  filter(TRNSGNDR == 'Male to female'|\n        TRNSGNDR ==  'Female to male'|\n        TRNSGNDR ==  'Gender non-conforming') %&gt;%\n  filter(X_AGEG5YR &gt; 4 & X_AGEG5YR &lt; 12) %&gt;% \n  filter(!is.na(HADMAM)) %&gt;%\n  select(TRNSGNDR, X_AGEG5YR, X_RACE, X_INCOMG, X_EDUCAG, HLTHPLN1, HADMAM) %&gt;%\n  mutate_all(as.factor) %&gt;%\n  #The next few mutates add labels to categorical variables based on the codebook. \n  mutate(X_AGEG5YR = recode_factor(X_AGEG5YR,\n          '5' = '40-44',\n          '6' = '45-49',\n          '7' = '50-54',\n          '8' = '55-59',\n          '9' = '60-64',\n          '10' = '65-69',\n          '11' = '70-74')) %&gt;%\n  mutate(X_INCOMG = recode_factor(X_INCOMG,\n          '1' = 'Less than 15,000',\n          '2' = '15,000 to less than 25,000',\n          '3' = '25,000 to less than 35,000',\n          '4' = '35,000 to less than 50,000',\n          '5' = '50,000 or more',\n          '9' = 'Don\\'t know/not sure/missing')) %&gt;%\n     mutate(X_EDUCAG = recode_factor(X_EDUCAG,\n          '1' = 'Did not graduate high school',\n          '2' = 'Graduated high school',\n          '3' = 'Attended college/technical school',\n          '4' = 'Graduated from college/technical school',\n          '9' = NA_character_)) %&gt;%\n     mutate(HLTHPLN1 = recode_factor(HLTHPLN1,\n          '1' = 'Yes',\n          '2' = 'No',\n          '7' = 'Don\\'t know/not sure/missing',\n          '9' = 'Refused')) %&gt;%\n     mutate(X_RACE = recode_factor(X_RACE,\n          '1' = 'White',\n          '2' = 'Black',\n          '3' = 'Native American',\n          '4' = 'Asian/Pacific Islander',\n          '5' = 'Other',\n          '6' = 'Other',\n          '7' = 'Other',\n          '8' = 'Other',\n          '9' = 'Other'))\n#print a summary\nsummary(brfss_small)     \n\n                  TRNSGNDR   X_AGEG5YR                     X_RACE   \n Male to female       : 77   40-44:27   White                 :152  \n Female to male       :113   45-49:27   Black                 : 31  \n Gender non-conforming: 32   50-54:32   Native American       :  4  \n Not transgender      :  0   55-59:44   Asian/Pacific Islander:  6  \n Not sure             :  0   60-64:44   Other                 : 29  \n Refused              :  0   65-69:24                               \n                             70-74:24                               \n                        X_INCOMG                                     X_EDUCAG \n Less than 15,000           :46   Did not graduate high school           :24  \n 15,000 to less than 25,000 :44   Graduated high school                  :86  \n 25,000 to less than 35,000 :19   Attended college/technical school      :68  \n 35,000 to less than 50,000 :26   Graduated from college/technical school:44  \n 50,000 or more             :65                                               \n Don't know/not sure/missing:22                                               \n\n HLTHPLN1  HADMAM \n Yes:198   1:198  \n No : 24   2: 22  \n           9:  2  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis data set full of categorical variables is now fully cleaned and ready to be analyzed!",

    "text": "Summary\n\nIn this lesson, we worked through the basics on data cleaning. Data cleaning is so important and there are so many ways to do it. Provided are some examples using popular functions in dplyr (under tidyverse).\n\n\nThe goals this lesson are to be able to create visualizations which help to describe a variable or variables more easily (descriptive statistics) and to explore patterns in the data based on groups or between two or more variables (inferential statistics).\n\n\nAt a Glance\n\nIn order to succeed in this lesson, we need to learn how to visualize data, noting that there are many ways to do this in R. This lesson presents common graphs used in R, and focuses on using ggplot2, a very common graphics package that is part of the tidyverse.\nBecause packages evolve fairly quickly, parameters within the commands shown in this section could evolve and adjust. The best way to figure out how to fine-tune your new graph is to explore options and parameter settings, while also using the open-source community.\nBy the end of this lesson, you should be able to create the following:\n\n\nCommon Graphs for a Single Categorical Variable\nCommon Graphs for a Single Continuous Variable\nCommon Graphs for Two Variables at Once\n\n\nThis lesson does not provide an exhaustive list of what you can do in R, but is a good starting point presenting some of the top graphs used in statistics with some common parameters added in.\n\n\n\nLesson Objectives\n\nChoose and create graphs for a single categorical variable.\nChoose and create graphs for a single continuous variable.\nChoose and create graphs for two variables at once.\n\n\n\nConsider While Reading\n\nIt is extremely useful to graph data in R in order to visualize what the data is telling us.\nWhen making graphs, there are a lot of ways to visualize data correctly, but there are just as many to do it incorrectly. Be careful not to force the data into the story you want it to tell.\nAlways be cautious when looking at visuals to make sure the data was handled properly.\nThe lesson is arranged by first evaluating the variable or variables of interest by data type (quantitative or quantitative) and then giving some examples of visualizations where this is commonly used. It is essential to make sure the variable is in the right data type before you create a chart. We look at many charts in this lesson including bar charts, density plots, boxplots and scatterplots. A multiple boxplot helps us understand the relationship between a grouping variable and a numerical variable. The scatterplot helps us understand if there is a relationship between two numerical variables and it helps us determine whether that relationship is linear or nonlinear.\nA lot of graphs you can do in ggplot, you can also do with base R. However, ggplot has much more capability to customize a specific format for your graphic.\n\nBase R has many options to graph a variable or variables. If all you want is some insight into the data, this might be the way to go.\nggplot2 is extremely popular graphing package and has a good pattern for making charts. You set the first layer with the ggplot() command and then add layers as needed for your graphic.\nThere are also other graphing packages that serve a specific purpose (i.e., waffle package in R).",

    "section": "Layering in ggplot",
    "text": "Layering in ggplot\n\nLayering is a fundamental concept in ggplot2 that allows you to build complex visualizations by adding different components (or “layers”) on top of each other. Each layer in a ggplot2 plot can represent different types of data, aesthetics, or annotations, enabling flexibility and control over how data is visualized. Layers can include geometries (e.g., points, lines, bars), statistical summaries, labels, grids, and themes.\nSeparation of Plot Components: Each layer can handle a different part of the plot. For example, one layer may be used for bars, another for labels, and another for a trend line. This allows you to build up a plot step by step.\nCustomization and Enhancement: By adding multiple layers, you can customize different aspects of the plot such as labels, colors, annotations, and theme elements. Each layer can be independently controlled.\nModularity: Layering allows you to modularize your plot construction, making it easier to add, remove, or modify parts of the plot without changing the entire structure.\nCombining Data Sources: Different layers can use different datasets or aesthetics, which is useful when you need to overlay one dataset on top of another (e.g., adding a regression line over a scatter plot).",

    "text": "Graphs for a Single Categorical Variable\n\nA categorical variable has categories that are either ordinal with a logical order or nominal with no logical order.\nCategorical variables need to be set as the factor data type in R to be able to be analyzed and visualized correctly.\nSome common graphing options for single categorical variable:\n\nBar graph\nPie chart\n\nIn any graph, it is beneficial to do any data cleaning and investigation into the variable(s) before you begin. With categorical variables, this may require recoding the factor(s) of interest and possibly renaming it/them to something meaningful if needed.\n\n\nBar Graph\n\nA bar graph depicts the frequency or the relative frequency for each category of the qualitative data as a bar rising vertically from the horizontal axis. A bar graph is also known as a bar chart and is often used to examine similarities and differences across categories of things; bars can represent frequencies, percentages, means, or other statistics.\nWe can learn a lot from a bar graph, like the marital status group with the highest and lowest frequencies according to the census.gov.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_bar()\n\nCreate a Bar Graph using ggplot() Command\nLike histograms, ggplot has many more parameters available over base R to construct bar graphs.\nFirst, we load tidyerse to access ggplot() command and others. You can always do this at the start of all your code to keep all the libraries together that are being used.\n\n\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\n\n\nggplot() works in layers, so you will routinely see the + symbol to kick off a new layer with added functionality.\nUsing the ggplot, we always include the aes() command first inside the ggplot() command. The aes() command is a quoting function that describes the variables being used. From there, it depends on the plot.\n\nFirst layer: ggplot() and aes() which calls the dataset and variables used.\nSecond layer: Graph type: Bar graph: geom_bar().\nAdditional layers: labs - for labels including titles; themes; and geom_text. Recreate the example below adding one layer at a time to see how the visualization changes.\n\n\n\n\nPertinent Parameters to the geom_bar()\n\nstat=“identity”: In ggplot2, the argument stat=“identity” is used inside the geom_bar when creating bar charts to specify that the actual values of the data should be plotted, rather than calculated summary statistics. By default, ggplot assumes that bar charts use stat=“count”, which counts the number of observations in each category. When you want to display the actual values in your dataset (e.g., sales numbers, average scores), you need to set stat=“identity” to ensure that the y-values are mapped directly from the data rather than being automatically counted.\nposition=“dodge”: If we have more than one categorical variable, we might set the position=“dodge” argument. This argument controls how the bars are positioned relative to each other when you are plotting multiple categories within a bar chart. By default, bars in a bar chart are stacked, and setting position=“dodge” ensures that they are placed side-by-side. This is particularly useful when you are comparing multiple groups or categories within the same plot, as it allows for a clear visual distinction between each group. In the example below, we only have one variable, so position=“dodge” argument is not needed.\n\nIn combination, using stat=“identity” and position=“dodge” is common when you want to compare different categories or groups with specific values in a side-by-side manner, ensuring the chart is easy to interpret. For example, if you are comparing sales figures across different products for multiple years, this approach would give you a bar for each product in each year, clearly separated.\nshow.legend = FALSE: In ggplot2, the argument show.legend = FALSE is used to hide the legend for a particular layer or the entire plot. By default, ggplot2 automatically adds a legend if you include aesthetics like color, size, or shape that distinguish groups in your data. If you don’t want the legend to appear, you can set show.legend = FALSE.\nscale_fill_manual(): When creating grouped bar charts or other plots with multiple categories, it’s important to ensure that the visual distinction between groups is clear. This is where manually setting the colors for each category comes into play. The scale_fill_manual() function in ggplot2 allows you to manually define the colors used for the filled areas, such as the bars in a bar chart or the shaded areas in an area chart. By using the values argument within scale_fill_manual(), you can specify a custom color palette that suits your design or presentation needs. For example, you might choose a palette of yellow and brown to represent different categories. A key aspect of using scale_fill_manual() effectively is knowing how many colors to provide. The number of colors you define in the values argument must match the number of levels or categories in your data. If you are comparing three product categories, for instance, you’ll need to provide exactly three colors—one for each category. Failing to match the number of colors to the number of categories can result in errors or misrepresentation in the plot. For example, if you have four levels (e.g., four different product categories or groups) and only provide two colors, ggplot may not know how to properly assign colors to the additional categories. Therefore, it’s crucial to know the number of distinct categories in your data and plan your color palette accordingly to maintain clarity and visual consistency in your chart.\n\n\n## inputting probabilities calculated from a 2023 multiple choice\n## question.

In doing so, lets use a dataset to make a bar graph instead of relying on pre-calculated data.\n\nLets examine the AUQ300 variable from the nhanes survey to run an example.\n\n\nnhanes &lt;- read.csv(\"data/nhanes2012.csv\")\n\n\nNext, we need to check the import by looking at the summary or head of the data.\n\n\n# Results hidden to save space, but gives you the first 6 records in\n# the data set.\nhead(nhanes)\n\n\nWe can also check the summary of data of only the variable of interest, AUQ300, to get a sense of what we are evaluating.\n\n\nsummary(nhanes$AUQ300)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n  1.000   1.000   2.000   1.656   2.000   7.000    4689 \n\n\n\nThe AUQ300 variable represents gun use. A screenshot of the codebook is copied below so that we can see what AUQ300 really refers to. It is available on https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2011-2012/AUQ_G.htm. This is always a necessary step because variable names can be convoluted and not representative of the variable definition.\n\n\n\n\nAUQ300\n\n\n\nRecode Variable if Needed\n\nLook to see if the AUQ300 needs recoding after looking at the codebook and making sense of the variable.\nAUQ300 needs to be a factor variable with 1 equaling a Yes and 2 equaling a No. We can use recode_factor to accomplish 2 things at once with the mutate function.\nrecode_factor() transforms the levels of a categorical variable (factor) into a new set of levels and is specific to categorical variables.\nrecode() is generic and can apply to numerical, categorical, or textual data, but still transforms data from one format or code to another.\n\n\nnhanes.clean &lt;- nhanes %&gt;%\n    select(AUQ300) %&gt;%\n    mutate(AUQ300 = recode_factor(AUQ300, `1` = \"Yes\", `2` = \"No\"))\n\n\nThen, we need to check the recode for accuracy. You should see the No’s and Yes’s alongside the rest being coded as NA’s.\n\n\nsummary(nhanes.clean)\n\n  AUQ300    \n Yes :1613  \n No  :3061  \n NA's:4690  \n\n\n\n\nGet Bar Roughly Plotted\n\nStart with the basic plot using the ggplot() and geom_bar() commands.\nBelow writes the statement with and without the piping operator.\n\nSince we are also going to use data preparation techniques, the piping operator is recommended.\n\n\n# Without piping operator\nggplot(nhanes.clean, aes(x = AUQ300)) + geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# With piping operator\nnhanes.clean %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = AUQ300)) + geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Functions to Clean Chart\n\nOmit the NA category from AUQ300 variable, which represents gun use. Then plot the graph below.\nThe drop_na() function is a good way to drop NA values from either the entire dataset or just one variable. It was introduced in the data prep lesson. Since we are only interested in dropping NA values from our one variable of interest that is to be graphed (AUQ300), we can put it in the parentheses so that we do not unintentionally drop lots of observations for no reason.\nAdd an axis labels under labs(x = …, y=…).\n\n\nnhanes.clean %&gt;%\n  drop_na(AUQ300) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = AUQ300)) + geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Gun use\", y = \"Number of participants\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##Here, we really benefit from the piping operator because we are doing more than one thing.\n\n\nFrom the bar graph, we can see that almost double the amount of people have not fired a firearm for any reason than those that fired one.\n\n\n\nAdding Color\n\nThere are many ways to add color to a bar graph. Below, the color is filled in directly in the aes() command by choosing it to give a different color to each categorical value of AUQ300.\n\nWhen fill is mapped to a variable, the fill color of the geom will vary based on the values of that variable. This is useful for distinguishing different groups or categories within the data. In this case the fill=AUQ300 gives a distinct color pattern based on how many categories there are considering the fact we are using the default “scale.”\n\n\nnhanes.clean %&gt;%\n  drop_na(AUQ300) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(AUQ300, fill=AUQ300)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Gun use\", y = \"Number of participants\", \n       subtitle = \"Filled inside the aes()\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Prep and Then Visualized\n\nIn the command below, we create a gss.2016.cleaned object to make a barplot. In doing so, we do the following:\nCreate a bar graph using the ggplot() command, which requires an aes() quoting function. This function says that we want to use the grass variable in our bar graph.\nDrop all NAs from the grass variable so that legal and not legal are the only categories.\nWe then create the bars and fill them with 2 colors, red and purple. Many color codes can be used here, and will be discussed in a later lesson.\nWe then add labels to our graph on both x and y axis.\nFinally, we print the new graph, which is saved under the legalize.bar object.\nBelow, I brought back over the code from the last part in Data Preparation. You should still have this in your Chapter1.R file. We are going to use that file to create a graphics in R.\n\n\ngss.2016 &lt;- read_csv(file = \"data/gss2016.csv\")\ngss.2016.cleaned &lt;- gss.2016 %&gt;%\n    mutate(grass = as.factor(grass)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(grass = na_if(x = grass, y = \"DK\")) %&gt;%\n    mutate(grass = na_if(x = grass, y = \"IAP\")) %&gt;%\n    mutate(grass = droplevels(x = grass)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(age = recode(age, `89 OR OLDER` = \"89\")) %&gt;%\n    mutate(age = as.numeric(x = age)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(age.cat = cut(x = age, breaks = c(-Inf, 29, 59, 74, Inf), labels = c(\"&lt; 30\",\n        \"30 - 59\", \"60 - 74\", \"75+\")))\n\n\nOnce the data is prepped, we can graph the variable or variables.\n\n\nggplot(gss.2016.cleaned, aes(grass)) + geom_bar()  ##with no piping operator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngss.2016.cleaned %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(grass)) + geom_bar()  ##with piping operator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Make a Bar Graph for Grass Variable\ngss.2016.cleaned %&gt;%\n    drop_na() %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(grass)) + geom_bar(fill = c(\"red\", \"blue\")) + labs(x = \"Should marijuana be legal\",\n    y = \"Frequency of Responses\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit The Graphic\n\nNext, we can edit these commands to include the age variable. The aes() quoting function has expanded to have the bars filled color using the grass variable, the age category has replaced the grass variable on the x axis.\n\n\ngss.2016.cleaned %&gt;%\n    drop_na() %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(age.cat, fill = grass)) + geom_bar() + labs(x = \"Age Category\",\n    y = \"Frequency of responses\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can add the position set at “dodge” inside the geom_bar() layer to make the barchart unstacked (or grouped).\n\n\ngss.2016.cleaned %&gt;%\n    drop_na() %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(age.cat, fill = grass)) + geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") +\n    labs(x = \"Age Category\", y = \"Frequency of responses\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can edit further to include a new a formula on the y axis to sum and count.\nIn the formula you provided, after_stat(count) is used within the ggplot2 framework to refer to the computed statistic generated by the geom_bar() function. Specifically, in the context of bar plots, count refers to the number of observations (or frequency) for each category within the data.\nWhen you use after_stat(count), you are referencing the count that is computed after geom_bar() has processed the data and calculated how many observations fall into each group (in this case, within each age category and the “grass” variable, which likely refers to attitudes toward marijuana legalization).\nWe also gave this a theme and updated the labels.\n\n\ngss.2016.cleaned %&gt;%\n    drop_na() %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(age.cat, y = 100 * (after_stat(count))/sum(after_stat(count)),\n        fill = grass)) + geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") + theme_minimal() +\n    labs(x = \"Age Category\", y = \"Percent of responses\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluate these graphs and see what information you can get from them.\n\n\n\n\nPie Chart\n\nA pie chart is a segmented circle whose segments portray the relative frequencies of the categories of a qualitative variable.\nSlices of pie in different colors represent the parts.\nIn this example, the firearm is divided by type to show parts of a whole, where the total of the proportions must add to 1.0 and the total of the percentages must add to 100%.\n\n\n# Importing data from working directory\nfbi.deaths &lt;- read.csv(\"data/fbi_deaths.csv\", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)\n# Selecting rows of interest for pie chart\nfbi.deaths.small &lt;- fbi.deaths[c(3, 4, 5, 6, 7), ]\nfbi.deaths.small &lt;- fbi.deaths.small %&gt;%\n    rename(Weapon = X)\n# Checking summary of fbi deaths\nsummary(fbi.deaths.small)\n\n                       Weapon      X2012          X2013          X2014     \n Firearms, type not stated:1   Min.   : 116   Min.   : 123   Min.   :  93  \n Handguns                 :1   1st Qu.: 298   1st Qu.: 285   1st Qu.: 258  \n Other guns               :1   Median : 310   Median : 308   Median : 264  \n Rifles                   :1   Mean   :1779   Mean   :1691   Mean   :1662  \n Shotguns                 :1   3rd Qu.:1769   3rd Qu.:1956   3rd Qu.:2024  \n Asphyxiation             :0   Max.   :6404   Max.   :5782   Max.   :5673  \n (Other)                  :0                                               \n     X2015          X2016     \n Min.   : 177   Min.   : 186  \n 1st Qu.: 258   1st Qu.: 262  \n Median : 272   Median : 374  \n Mean   :1956   Mean   :2201  \n 3rd Qu.:2502   3rd Qu.:3077  \n Max.   :6569   Max.   :7105  \n                              \n\n\n\nAgain, ggplot works in layers, so in order to make a pie, you need a few layers and have a few optional ones.\n\nThe aes() command specifies the variable to create the pie, in this case x2016.\ngeom_col() sets the borders of the pie and makes it visible.\ncoord_polar() command makes the pie circular.\ntheme_void() command is optional and adjusts the theme of the pie. to remove axis, background, etc.\n\n\n\nggplot(fbi.deaths.small, aes(x=\"\", y=X2016, fill=Weapon)) +\n  geom_col() + \n  coord_polar(\"y\", start=0) + \n  theme_void() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the pie, we can see that the majority of weapons that caused fbi gun related deaths are handguns followed by a type of firearm that is not stated.\n\n\n\nComparison of Charts\n\nRecommended graphs for single categorical or factor type variable:\n\nBar graph, for showing relative group sizes.\nPie charts are available in R but are not recommended because they tend to be less clear for comparing group sizes.\n\nPie charts are difficult to read since the relative size of pie pieces is often hard to determine.\nPie charts take up a lot of space to convey little information.\nPeople often use fancy formatting like 3D, which takes up more space and makes understanding relative size of pie pieces even more difficult.",

    "text": "Graphs for a Single Continuous Variable\n\nA continuous variable refers to a variable that can take any value over a range of values.\nA continuous variable needs to be numeric, and could be integer type or numeric type in R. Just like with graphs that include categorical variables, it is beneficial to do any data cleaning and investigation into the variable(s) before you begin. With continuous variables, this may require recoding the variable to coerce it to the appropriate data type and/or renaming it to something meaningful if needed.\nIt is also beneficial to make sure the numerical variable is indeed supposed to be numerical (as opposed to a factor). For instance, you commonly see numbers listed for categories like the Yes/No coded as a 1/2, such as with the AUQ300 variable.\n\nSome common graphing options for single continuous variable:\n\nHistograms (From Lesson 2)\nDensity plots\nBoxplots\nViolin plots\n\n\nHistograms\n\nA histogram is a useful plot to determine central tendency and spread.\nWe went over histograms in Lesson 2, so refer back for information on how to create a histogram using base R and ggplot.\nRemember that you can tell the distribution from a histogram, and that distribution can be normal or skewed (Right or Left).\n\nWith each chart based on quantitative data, you should be able to get a sense of the distribution.\nThe histogram below looks right skewed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDensity Plots\n\nA density plot is similar to a histogram but more fluid in appearance because it does not have the separate bins.\n\nProbability density is not very useful for interpreting what is happening at any given value of the variable on the x-axis, but it is useful in computing the percentage of values that are within a range along the x-axis.\nThe area under the curve in a density plot could be interpreted as the probability of a single observation or a range of observations.\nWe can use random normal data to create the density plot like shown below with a sample of 1000, a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 2. To do this, we need to make the vector and assign it to a data frame.\nIn R, set.seed() is a function used to set the seed for random number generation. By setting a seed using set.seed(), you ensure reproducibility of your code. If you run the same code with the same seed, you’ll get the same sequence of random numbers every time. This is particularly useful for debugging, testing, or when you want to ensure that your results are reproducible.\nWe use set.seed before any function with a random normal generator to ensure reproducibility.\nIf a dataset is provided, then you do not need to generate your own random data as shown in the step below.\n\n\n\nset.seed(1)\nx &lt;- rnorm(1000, mean = 10, sd = 2)\ndf &lt;- data.frame(x)\n\n\nNext, we can make the density plot using the ggplot2 package under tidyverse.\n\nLayer 2 includes the geom_density() command in addition to the standard Layer 1 ggplot() command to create the density plot.\n\n\n\nggplot(df, aes(x)) + geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of arguments you can change. I selected a couple below. Be sure to look at the help file on the geom_density() layer to get the variety on what you can do.\n\ncolor = sets a line color\nlwd = makes the line thicker. Increase this number for thicker line.\nfill= colors the area under the curve.\nalpha= sets the transparency to the area under the curve.\n\n\n\nggplot(df, aes(x)) + geom_density(color = \"darkblue\", lwd = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(df, aes(x)) + geom_density(color = \"darkblue\", fill = \"lightblue\",\n    alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can even add a mean line, which we know in this case is 10 because we used random normal data with that mean set as a parameter.\ngeom_vline() is a function used to add vertical lines to a plot created with ggplot. This function is useful for visually indicating specific points or ranges on the x-axis.\nYou can do a line break in your R code after a comma (\\(,\\)) or after a plus sign (\\(+\\)). I find things easier to read on less lines, but it is personal preference how many lines you use given still following the rules in R.\n\n\n\nggplot(df, aes(x)) + geom_density(color = \"darkblue\", fill = \"lightblue\",\n    alpha = 0.5) + geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(x)), color = \"red\",\n    linetype = \"dashed\", lwd = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou do not need the rnorm function if you are provided a dataset with a numerical variable.

It is executed again below.\n\n\nGrowthFund &lt;- c(-38.32, 1.71, 3.17, 5.99, 12.56, 13.47, 16.89, 16.96, 32.16,\n    36.29)\nGrowthFund &lt;- as.data.frame(GrowthFund)\n\n\nWe can use ggplot to retrieve our graph and associated numbers.\nThe outlier is visually depicted on the graph as -38.32.\n\n\nggplot(GrowthFund, aes(GrowthFund)) + geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can add a little color to the plot with the fill parameter, but then we also need to be sure to turn off the legends in the geom_boxplot.\n\n\nggplot(GrowthFund, aes(GrowthFund)) + geom_boxplot(fill = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can add parameters to make this visualization more professional, but this gets you started. Be sure to look at some examples in the R community or on ChatGPT.\nAnother example below using the mtcars dataset.\n\n\nmtcars %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x=\"\", y = mpg)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill=\"lightgreen\") +\n  theme_minimal() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsemTools::skew(mtcars$mpg)  #normal\n\nskew (g1)        se         z         p \n    0.672     0.433     1.553     0.120 \n\nsemTools::kurtosis(mtcars$mpg)  #mesokurtic\n\nExcess Kur (g2)              se               z               p \n         -0.022           0.866          -0.025           0.980 \n\n\n\nLooks like the mpg variable is quite normal with one potential outlier to the right, but no major signs of skewness or kurtosis.\nWe can also get a histogram of mpg and are able to make the same claims towards normality. You can see a slight pull to the right, but it is seemingly normal. A higher sample size could help here.\n\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = \"black\",\n    fill = \"green\")",

    "text": "Graphs for Two Variables At Once\n\nCombinations of 2 Variable Types for Graphing\n\nTwo categorical/ factor.\nOne categorical/ factor and one continuous/ numeric.\nTwo continuous/ numeric.\n\n\n\nBar Graphs for Two Categorical Variables\n\nThere are two formats available for bar charts:\n\nGrouped\nStacked\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   vs, gear [6]\n     vs  gear     n\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1     0     3    12\n2     0     4     2\n3     0     5     4\n4     1     3     3\n5     1     4    10\n6     1     5     1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrouped Bar Graph\n\nGrouped bar graph allow comparison of multiple sets of data items, with a single color used to denote a specific series across all sets.\nFor example, we can look at both the vs and gear variables in the ggplot command.\n\nYou can do a little grouping and counting before you began to generate a new table with frequencies based on vs and gear variables. Once a new dataset object is made, you can make the graph with the geom_bar layer specifying the stat=“identity”.\nSince there are two variables, you can set the position to dodge to view the fill categorical variable side by side.\n(stat = “identity”) tells ggplot that the y values are already computed and should be used as-is for the heights of the bars. In this case, they are frequencies calculated in the countsDF dataset.\n\n\n\nmtcars &lt;- mtcars %&gt;%\n    mutate(vs = as.factor(vs)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(gear = as.factor(gear))\n\n\ncountsDF &lt;- mtcars %&gt;%\n    group_by(vs, gear) %&gt;%\n    count()\n\nsummary(countsDF)\n\n vs    gear        n         \n 0:3   3:2   Min.   : 1.000  \n 1:3   4:2   1st Qu.: 2.250  \n       5:2   Median : 3.500  \n             Mean   : 5.333  \n             3rd Qu.: 8.500  \n             Max.   :12.000  \n\nggplot(countsDF, aes(x = gear, y = n, fill = vs)) + geom_bar(stat = \"identity\",\n    position = \"dodge\") + labs(title = \"Grouped Car Distribution by Gears and VS\",\n    x = \"Number of Gears\", y = \"Count\") + theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStacked Bar Graph\n\nA Stacked bar graph extends the standard bar graph from looking at numeric values across one categorical variable to two. Each bar in a standard bar graph is divided into a number of sub-bars stacked end to end, each one corresponding to a level of the second categorical variable.\nUsing ggplot, we can also stack these charts by removing the position = dodge statement.\n\n\nggplot(countsDF, aes(x = gear, y = n, fill = vs)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Stacked Car Distribution\",\n       x = \"Number of Gears\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBar Graph for Continuous Across Groups\n\nIn comparison to a bar graph for a single categorical variable, a bar chart for a continuous variable across groups includes both a x and y axis. The continuous variable is put on the y axis, and the categorical (factor) variable is placed on the x axis showing the groups.\nTherefore, instead of counting data based on group, we can see another continuous variable based on group data.\nThe frequency data (i.e., counts) can be replaced with another numerical variable like mean.\nIn the below example, instead of counting observations per group, here, we took the average mpg (a continuous variable) based on groups of gear and vs and summarized the data into a variable avg_mpg. We then used that variable in a ggplot() command to create a unique chart to that above.\n\n\navg_mpg &lt;- mtcars %&gt;%\n    group_by(gear, vs) %&gt;%\n    summarise(mpg = mean(mpg, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\nggplot(avg_mpg, aes(gear,\n  mpg, fill = vs)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Average MPG by VS and Gear\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, we can add color using the scale_fill_manual. Since there are two colors, we use the c() command to combine them together inside the layer.\n\n\nggplot(avg_mpg, aes(gear, mpg, fill = vs)) + geom_bar(stat = \"identity\",\n    position = \"dodge\", color = \"black\") + ggtitle(\"Average MPG by VS and Gear\") +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"yellow\", \"brown\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxplot for Continuous Across Groups\n\nA boxplot requires one continuous variable (like we did above). When we include an additional grouping variable, we get multiple boxplots, one for each group. This allows us to directly compare distributions.\nThe categorical variable should correctly be a factor data type before you begin.\nIn the example below, mpg is the continuous variable, and gear is the categorical variable.\nWe see 3 boxplots for three values of gear (3, 4, 5). ggplot() and geom_boxplot() are required components of the command. The scale_fill_manual() and theme_minimal() layers are optional ways to change the style and color.\n\n\nmtcars %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = gear, y = mpg, fill = gear)) +\n  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"gray\", \"red\", \"blue\")) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLets alter the functions above to depict mpg based on vs with categorical states 0 and 1.\n\n\nmtcars %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = vs, y = mpg, fill = vs)) + geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"gray\", \"red\")) + theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScatterplot for Two Continuous Variables\n\nScatterplots\n\nA scatterplot is used to determine if two continuous variables are related.\n\nEach point is a pairing: \\((x_1, y_1),(x_2, y_2),\\) etc.\n\nOur goal with a scatterplot is to characterize the relationship by visual inspection. This includes determining if the relationship looks positive, negative, or not existent.\n\n\n\n\nScatterPlot Results\n\n\n\nSometimes, it is really clear how to characterize the relationship. Other times, additional statistical tests are needed to confirm the relationship (which we will go over in later lessons). This is true especially with big data, where the plot window can look like a giant blog of observations.\nLet’s work a clean example examining the relationship between income and the years of education one has had.\nThis plot has a clear positive trend, meaning that as one has more years of education, we see higher income. And similarly, as we see higher income, we also see more years of education. This means that a scatter can help characterize the relationship, and does not state that one variable is causing another to occur.\n\n\nEdu &lt;- read.csv(\"data/education.csv\")\nplot(Edu$Income ~ Edu$Education, ylab = \"Income\", xlab = \"Education\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with ggplot instead of base R, we would use the following code.\n\nLayer 1: ggplot() command with aes() command directly inside of it pointing to x and y variables.\nLayer 2: geom_point() command to add the observations as indicators in the chart.\nLayer 3 or more: many other optional additions like labs (for labels) as shown below.\n\n\nggplot(Edu, aes(x = Education, y = Income)) + geom_point() + labs(y = \"Income\",\n    x = \"Education\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_point() has some parameters you can change like shape = where you can add depth to your chart. Some common shapes of geom_point are as follows.\n\n\n# shape = 0, square shape = 1, circle shape = 2, triangle point up\n# shape = 3, plus shape = 4, cross shape = 5, diamond shape = 6,\n# triangle point down shape = 7, square cross shape = 8, star shape =\n# 9, diamond plus shape = 10, circle plus shape = 11, triangles up\n# and down shape = 12, square plus shape = 13, circle cross shape =\n# 14, square and triangle down shape = 15, filled square shape = 16,\n# filled circle shape = 17, filled triangle point-up shape = 18,\n# filled diamond\n\n\nFor instance, the code below changes the color, shape, and size of the geom_point().\n\n\nggplot(Edu, aes(x = Education, y = Income)) + geom_point(color = \"#183028\",\n    shape = 18, size = 10) + labs(y = \"Income\", x = \"Education\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_line() in R’s ggplot2 package is used to create line plots, which connect data points with straight lines. It is commonly used to visualize trends over time or continuous relationships between variables.\nggplot allows us to add a geom_line, which is helpful in drawing a line through the data. Here, I am also resetting the color off of the default value. You see this a lot on time series models like stock charts.\n\n\nggplot(Edu, aes(x = Education, y = Income)) + geom_point(color = \"#183028\",\n    shape = 18, size = 4) + labs(y = \"Income\", x = \"Education\") + geom_line(color = \"#789F90\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn R’s ggplot2 package, geom_smooth() is used to add a trendline (also called a smoothing line or a regression line) to a plot. It fits a line or curve through your data points based on a smoothing method, allowing you to visualize the general relationship between the x and y variables. The trendline can help reveal patterns such as linear relationships or trends in noisy data. The trendline give us 2 parts:\n\nTrendline: This line represents the fitted relationship between the two variables, which could be linear, polynomial, or a more flexible curve depending on the smoothing method used.\nConfidence Interval: The shaded area (often gray by default) around the trendline shows the confidence interval, giving a sense of the uncertainty of the fit.\n\nWe can change our line to a geom_smooth line, which is considered a trendline to help us visualize the relationship between the variables.\n\n\nggplot(Edu, aes(x = Education, y = Income)) + geom_point(color = \"#183028\",\n    shape = 18, size = 4) + labs(y = \"Income\", x = \"Education\") + geom_smooth(color = \"#789F90\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can change the type of trendline. The most common is the to develop the trendline using the lm method, which stands for the linear method that we are going to learn in the Regression lesson. For now, lets insert _method=“lm” into our geom_smooth() later to see the change.\nThe gray band on a scatter plot in R usually represents the confidence interval around a fitted line when you plot it using geom_smooth() in ggplot2. This gray area visualizes the uncertainty or variability of the estimated regression line, providing a sense of how confident we are about the predictions at different points along the line.\n\n\nggplot(Edu, aes(x = Education, y = Income)) + geom_point() + labs(y = \"Income\",\n    x = \"Education\") + geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"#789F90\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike geom_smooth(), which fits a trendline or smoothing line to data, geom_line() directly connects the raw data points in the order they appear (typically by the x-axis values). In business statistics class that teaches linear regression, we use more trendlines than geom_lines.\nLet’s look at a few more examples and see if the relationship is considered positive, negative, or not existent.\nBelow, we see a negative trend.\n\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = \"lm\",\n    color = \"#789F90\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn regards to the hp variable, below, we see another negative trend.\n\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = \"lm\",\n    color = \"#789F90\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn regards to the qsec variable, below, we see a weak positive trend. This relationship would need to verified later on.\n\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = qsec, y = mpg)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = \"lm\",\n    color = \"#789F90\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot() command also works when you do not have 2 continuous variables, and instead have one categorical variable paired with one continuous variable. However, the plot is not as adequate as others are in inferring the relationship from the variables.\nFor example, the plot below would be better served as a boxplot.\n\n\nplot(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$cyl)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nboxplot(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$cyl)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing ggplot, we would have the same issue. Since vs is a categorical variable, it does not look right when we use the geom_point() later.\n\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, we would want the geom_boxplot() layer like shown below. The geom_smooth() is also not an applicable layer to a boxplot and would need to be removed.\n\nWhen you create multiple boxplots in ggplot2 and one or more variables are numeric but not converted to factors, only one boxplot may show up because ggplot2 treats numeric variables as continuous. Boxplots group data by categorical variables, so if your variable is continuous, ggplot interprets it as a single category and produces only one boxplot.\nBelow, we still have an error.\n\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) + geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething still is not quite right here, so we would need to make sure cyl is correctly a factor before making the boxplot. Now, we should see multiple boxplots, one for each categorical level. To fix this, you need to convert the grouping variable to a factor using as.factor() in your data, so ggplot will recognize it as a categorical variable and display multiple boxplots accordingly.\n\n\nmtcars &lt;- mtcars %&gt;%\n    mutate(cyl = as.factor(cyl))\nggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) + geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry to Recreate\n\nYou try examples of scatterplots using the UScrime data set that is part of the MASS package to examine a few relationships using ggplot2. A few examples are below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee what information you can take away from the scatterplots above and create some more to practice.",

    "section": "List Comprehension",
    "text": "List Comprehension\n\nIntroduction: What Is a List Comprehension?\nA list comprehension is a concise, elegant way to create new lists in Python — often replacing multi-line loops with a single readable line. Think of it as a powerful shorthand that lets you transform, filter, and process data with minimal code.\nLet’s start with the traditional approach\n\n\n[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n\n\nThis works fine, but it’s a bit long for such a simple task. We need three separate steps: initialize an empty list, loop through values, and append results one by one.\nThat’s why we have List Comprehensions in Python. Python lets you compress those three steps into one clean line using list comprehension, making your code more Pythonic and easier to read.\nThe general syntax is:\n[ expression for item in iterable]\nWhere:\n\nexpression → what you want to do with each item (like squaring a number or making text uppercase)\nfor item in iterable → the loop through your data (like numbers, strings, or lists)\nThe entire comprehension is wrapped in square brackets [] which tells Python to create a new list\n\nLet’s rewrite our earlier example:\n\n\n[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n\n\nSame output, shorter code and once you get used to it, it is much more readable! Notice how we eliminated the need to initialize an empty list and manually append values.\nList comprehensions work on any iterable, not just numbers. Let’s try it with strings.\n\n\n['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'KIWI', 'GRAPE']\n\n\nHere this code is saying: “Take each fruit in fruits, make it uppercase, and collect the results in a new list.” The .upper() method is applied to every string automatically as we loop through.\n\n\nExercises\nExercise 1: Word Lengths\nCreate a new list called lengths that contains the length of each word in the list.\nEnter Code here\n\n\n[6, 8, 4, 8, 7]\n\n\nExercise 2: Filtering with Conditions\nCreate a list called long_words that includes only words longer than 6 characters.\nEnter Code here\n\n\n['bootcamp', 'listcomp', 'concise']\n\n\nExercise 3: Filtering and Transforming Numbers\nFrom the numbers 1–20, make a new list called divisible_by_3_doubled that:\n\nOnly includes numbers divisible by 3\nDoubles each of those numbers\n\nEnter Code here\n\n\n[6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36]\n\n\n\n\nAdding Conditions: if, else and elif\nList comprehensions are not just for simple loops. You can also add conditional logic to decide what gets included or what value is produced. This is where list comprehensions become truly powerful, allowing you to filter data and transform values based on specific criteria.\n\nUsing if as a Filter\nYou can use if at the end of a comprehension to only include items that meet a condition. This acts as a filter, letting only certain items “pass through” into your new list.\n\n\n[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n\n\nStep-by-step:\n\nLoop through each num in numbers (1 through 10).\nCheck if num % 2 == 0 → only even numbers pass the filter.\nThe expression num is added to the new list if the condition is True.\nOdd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) are skipped entirely.\n\nOutput: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\nKey Point: When if appears at the END of the comprehension, it’s a filter. Items that don’t meet the condition are excluded from the result.\n\n\nUsing if–else in Expressions\nSometimes you want all items included, but with different values depending on a condition. Here, the if–else is inside the expression at the beginning, not at the end. This means every item will appear in the new list, but their values will be transformed differently based on the condition.\n\n\n['odd', 'even', 'odd', 'even', 'odd']\n\n\nStep-by-step:\n\nLoop through each num (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\nCheck the condition: num % 2 == 0\n\nIf True → add the string \"even\"\nIf False → add the string \"odd\"\n\nEvery number produces a result — nothing is filtered out.\n\nOutput: ['odd', 'even', 'odd', 'even', 'odd']\nKey Point: When if–else appears at the BEGINNING (in the expression), it transforms values rather than filtering. Every item is included, just with different values.\n\n\nChaining Conditions (Like elif)\nPython does not have a direct elif in a comprehension, but you can chain multiple if–else expressions to create multi-way branching logic. The conditions are evaluated in order from left to right, and the first true condition determines the output.\nExample: Categorizing Student Scores\n\n\n['Excellent', 'Good', 'Needs Improvement', 'Good', 'Needs Improvement', 'Needs Improvement']\n\n\nStep-by-step:\n\nLoop through each s in scores.\nCheck first condition s &gt;= 90:\n\nIf True → assign \"Excellent\" and stop checking\nIf False → move to next condition\n\nCheck second condition s &gt;= 70:\n\nIf True → assign \"Good\" and stop checking\nIf False → assign the default \"Needs Improvement\"\n\nThis creates a cascading decision tree for each score.\n\nOutput: ['Excellent', 'Good', 'Needs Improvement', 'Good', 'Needs Improvement', 'Good']\nExample: Temperature Categories\n\n\n['Hot', 'Warm', 'Warm', 'Cold', 'Hot', 'Cold', 'Warm']\n\n\nStep-by-step:\n\nLoop through each t in temps.\nCheck t &gt;= 30:\n\nIf True → assign \"Hot\" (like 35 and 30)\n\nElse check t &gt;= 20:\n\nIf True → assign \"Warm\" (like 28, 22, 25)\n\nElse assign \"Cold\" (like 18 and 10)\nEach temperature gets exactly one category.\n\nOutput: ['Hot', 'Warm', 'Warm', 'Cold', 'Hot', 'Cold', 'Warm']\nTip: You can chain as many if–else conditions as needed to mimic elif logic in a single comprehension. Just remember that they’re evaluated left to right, and the first matching condition wins.\n\n\nFiltering + Conditional Output\nYou can also combine filtering (if at the end) with conditional expressions inside the comprehension. This gives you maximum flexibility: transform values differently based on one condition, then filter the results based on another condition.\n\n\n[1, 4, 3, 8, 5, 12, 7, 16, 9]\n\n\nStep-by-step:\n\nLoop through numbers 1–15.\nFilter (at the end): only include numbers &lt; 10 (so 1-9 are considered).\nExpression (at the beginning):\n\nIf even → double it (2→4, 4→8, 6→12, 8→16)\nIf odd → keep as-is (1→1, 3→3, 5→5, 7→7, 9→9)\n\nNumbers 10-15 are excluded before transformation even happens.\n\nOutput: [1, 4, 3, 8, 5, 12, 7, 16, 9]\nOrder of Operations: Python first filters the items (the if at the end), then applies the transformation expression to each item that passed the filter.\n\n\n\nNested Comprehensions (2D Lists)\nList comprehensions can also loop over multiple levels of data, like lists of lists (2D lists or matrices). This is called a nested comprehension. While it might look complex at first, it follows the same left-to-right reading pattern as nested for-loops.\n\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n\n\nExplanation and step-by-step overview:\n\nFirst loop: for row in matrix — Loop through each row in matrix (each row is a list).\nSecond loop: for num in row — Then loop through each num in that row.\nExpression: num — Collect each num into a new flat list.\nReading order: Read left to right, just like you would write nested for-loops.\n\nThis is equivalent to the following traditional nested loop, but much shorter and cleaner:\n\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n\n\nOutput: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nVisualization: The 3×3 matrix is “flattened” into a single list of 9 numbers, preserving the order from left to right, top to bottom.\n\n\nQuick Recap: List Comprehensions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcept\nSyntax\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\nBasic\n[x for x in iterable]\nLoop through values and collect them\n[n for n in range(5)]\n\n\nFilter\n[x for x in iterable if condition]\nInclude only items meeting condition (filter at the end)\n[n for n in range(10) if n%2==0]\n\n\nConditional\n[expr_if_true if cond else expr_if_false for x in iterable]\nChange output based on condition (all items included)\n[\"even\" if n%2==0 else \"odd\" for n in range(6)]\n\n\nChained / elif\n[expr1 if cond1 else expr2 if cond2 else expr3 for x in iterable]\nMultiple condition branches (cascading logic)\n[\"High\" if s&gt;=90 else \"Medium\" if s&gt;=70 else \"Low\" for s in scores]\n\n\nNested\n[item for sublist in list_of_lists for item in sublist]\nFlatten or loop through nested lists (read left to right)\n[num for row in matrix for num in row]\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Ideas\n\nPerformance: List comprehensions are faster than traditional loops because they’re optimized at the interpreter level.\nReadability: Keep comprehensions readable — if it gets too complex, break it into multiple lines or use a traditional loop.\nUse cases: Use comprehensions when transforming or filtering data; use traditional loops for more complex logic with multiple operations.\nMemory: For very large datasets, consider using generator expressions (x for x in iterable) instead of list comprehensions to save memory.",

Along with its if expression counterpart, it’s the primary selection tool in Python and represents much of the logic a Python program possesses. It’s also our first compound statement. Like all such statements, the if statement may contain other statements, including other ifs. In fact, Python lets you combine statements in a program both sequentially (so that they execute one after another), and in an arbitrarily nested fashion (so that they execute only under certain conditions, such as selections and loops).\nAn if statement tells Python: “Only run this block of code if a certain condition is true.”\nThink of it like a business rule: If revenue is above target, then give a performance bonus.\nSyntax:\n\n\nSimple Example\n\n\nBonus approved!\n\n\nBecause the condition revenue &gt; target is true, Python prints the message.\nTry changing revenue to a smaller number and re-run the code and see if it still prints the same thing.\n\n\nIf-Else\nWhat if we also want to say something when the condition is not true? That’s where else comes in.\n\n\nNeeds improvement.\n\n\nPython checks the if condition first. If it’s false, it runs the else block instead.\n\n\nMultiple Conditions\nWhen you have more than two possibilities, use elif (“else if”).\n\n\nGrade: B\n\n\nPython checks the conditions in order and runs the first one that’s true.\n\n\nCombining Conditions\nYou can combine multiple conditions using:\n\nand → both must be true\nor → at least one is true\nnot → reverses true/false\n\n\n\nEligible for credit card\n\n\n\n\nNested Statements\nYou can also put one if inside another for more complex logic.\n\n\nYou can enter.\n\n\nThis structure is common in data workflows — checking multiple business rules in sequence.\n\n\nPractice\nWrite your own example:\n\nAsk for a test score (input)\nPrint “Excellent” if 90+, “Good” if 80–89, otherwise “Needs Improvement”",

    "section": "Loop Basics",
    "text": "Loop Basics\nPython’s while statement is the most general iteration construct in the language. In simple terms, it repeatedly executes an associated block of statements as long as a test at the top keeps evaluating to a true value. It is called a “loop” because control keeps looping back to the start of the statement until the test becomes false. When the test does become false, control passes to the statement that follows the while block. The net effect is that the loop’s body is executed repeatedly while the test at the top is true. If the test is false to begin with, the body never runs and the while statement is skipped.\nBasically sometimes we need to repeat a task several times — or until a condition changes.\nExample in plain language: While there are still customers in line → keep serving.\nIn Python the syntax is:\nThe loop runs again and again as long as the condition is true.\n\n\nHello, world!\nHello, world!\nHello, world!\n\n\nThis prints three lines because:\n\nStart: count = 1\nEach loop: print, then add 1\nStop when count &lt;= 3 becomes false\n\n\nInfinite Loops\nIf the condition never becomes false, the loop never ends.\nAlways make sure something inside your loop changes the condition.\n\n\nLoop Control\nIn Python we can control loop flow manually.\nbreak: Jumps out of the closest enclosing loop (past the entire loop statement)\ncontinue: Jumps to the top of the closest enclosing loop (to the loop’s header line)\npass: Does nothing at all: it’s an empty statement placeholder\nLoop else block: Runs if and only if the loop is exited normally (i.e., without hitting a break)\nbreak and continue statements can appear anywhere inside the while (or per ahead, for) loop’s body, but they are usually coded further nested in an if test to take action in response to some condition.\nbreak → exit the loop early\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\ncontinue → skip this iteration\n\n\n1\n2\n4\n5\n\n\n\n\nWhile-Else\nA while loop can also have an else block that runs when the loop ends normally (without break).\n\n\nx = 3\nx = 2\nx = 1\nLoop finished!\n\n\n\n\nCombined Example\nWe can combine both ideas to make small, smart programs.\nExplanation:\n\nThe while loop keeps asking until the user guesses correctly.\nThe if inside checks how the guess compares to the secret number.\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nConcept\nPurpose\nExample\n\n\n\n\nif\nRun code when condition is true\nif x &gt; 5:\n\n\nelse\nRun code when condition is false\nelse:\n\n\nelif\nTest another condition\nelif x == 5:\n\n\nwhile\nRepeat while condition is true\nwhile x &lt; 10:\n\n\nbreak\nExit the loop early\nbreak\n\n\ncontinue\nSkip current iteration\ncontinue",

    "text": "In this online book, we went over information to make sure you had some basics to really start learning R. This journey began with the basics of R, emphasizing that while multiple methods exist to achieve the same results in R, it’s crucial to find the approach that works best for you. As we learn R, you will get used to doing things your way to be able to slice and evaluate the data to find rich information from the data sets we look at. As long as the data was handled properly, it does not matter how we reach our goal using R as long as we do it ourselves.\nMastering R allows you to effectively clean, analyze, and interpret data, unlocking valuable insights from various datasets. We explored the essential practice of data cleaning, learning various techniques and popular functions within the dplyr package under the tidyverse. Proper data cleaning ensures the integrity and accuracy of your analysis. We delved into skewness, kurtosis, variables, and scales of measurement, focusing on summarizing qualitative and quantitative data. Visualizations were introduced as powerful tools to describe variables and uncover patterns in the data.\nWe examined basic probability rules were covered alongside binomial and continuous distributions. We examined the normal distribution, its limitations, and methods for transforming non-normal variables. Central limit theorem is discussed with the Empirical rule alongside normal distributions.\n\nThis book has equipped you with the foundational skills needed to handle data before deeply analyzing it using R. Remember, the key to mastering these techniques lies in consistent practice and finding the methods that best suit your analytical style.",
