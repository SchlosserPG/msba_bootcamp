    "section": "7.7 Built-in Functions",
    "text": "7.7 Built-in Functions\n\nR has thousands of built-in functions including those for summary statistics. Below, we use a few built-in functions with constant numbers. The sqrt(), max(), and min() functions compute the square root of a number, and find the maximum and minimum numbers in a vector.\n\n\nsqrt(100)\n\n[1] 10\n\nmax(100, 200, 300)\n\n[1] 300\n\nmin(100, 200, 300)\n\n[1] 100\n\n\n\nWe can also create variables to use within built-in functions.\nBelow, we create a vector x and use a few built-in functions as examples.\n\nThe sort() function sorts a vector from small to large.\n\n\nx &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 3, 100, -10, 40)  #Creating a Vector x\nsort(x)  #Sorting the Vector x from Small to Large\n\n[1] -10   1   2   3   3  40 100\n\nmax(x)  #Finding Largest Element of Vector x\n\n[1] 100\n\nmin(x)  #Finding Smallest Element of Vector x\n\n[1] -10\n\n\n\n\n7.7.1 Built-in Functions: Setting an Argument\n\nThe standard format to a built-in function is functionName(argument)\n\nFor example, the square root function structure is listed as sqrt(x), where x is a numeric or complex vector or array.\n\n\n\n# Here, we are setting a required argument x to a value of 100. When\n# a value is set, it turns it to a parameter of the function.\nsqrt(x = 100)\n\n[1] 10\n\n# Because there is only one argument and it is required, we can\n# eliminate its name x= from our function call. This is discussed\n# below.\nsqrt(100)\n\n[1] 10\n\n\n\nThere is a little variety in how we can write functions to get the same results.\nA parameter is what a function can take as input. It is a placeholder and hence does not have a concrete value. An argument is a value passed during function invocation.\nThere are some default values set up in R in which arguments have already been set.\nThere are a few functions with no parameters like Sys.time() which produces the date and time. If you are not sure how many parameters a function has, you should look it up in the help.\n\n\n\n7.7.2 Default Values\n\nThere are many default values set up in R in which arguments have already been set to a particular value or field.\nDefault values have been set when you see the = value in the instructions. If we don’t want to change it, we don’t need to include it in our function call.\nWhen only one argument is required, the argument is usually not set to have a default value.\n\n\n\n7.7.3 Built-in Functions: Using More than One Argument\n\nFor functions with more than one parameter, we must determine what arguments we want to include, and whether a default value was set and if we want to change it. Default values have been set when you see the = value in the instructions. If we don’t want to change it, we don’t need to include it in our function call.\n\nFor example, the default S3 method for the seq() function is listed as the following: seq(from = 1, to = 1, by = ((to - from)/(length.out - 1)),length.out = NULL, along.with = NULL, …)\nDefault values have been set on each parameter, but we can change some of them to get a meaningful result.\nFor example, we set the from, to, and by parameter to get a sequence from 0 to 30 in increments of 5.\n\n\n\n# We can use the following code.\nseq(from = 0, to = 30, by = 5)\n\n[1]  0  5 10 15 20 25 30\n\n\n\nWe can simplify this function call even further:\n\nIf we use the same order of parameters as the instructions, we can eliminate the argument= from the function.\nSince we do list the values to the arguments in same order as the function is defined, we can eliminate the from=, to=, and by= to simplify the statement.\n\n\n# Equivalent statement as above\nseq(0, 30, 5)\n\n[1]  0  5 10 15 20 25 30\n\n\nIf you leave off the by parameter, it defaults at 1.\n\n\n# Leaving by= to default value of 1\nseq(0, 30)\n\n [1]  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24\n[26] 25 26 27 28 29 30\n\n\n\nThere can be a little hurdle deciding when you need the argument value in the function call. The general rule is that if you don’t know, include it. If it makes more sense to you to include it, include it.\n\n\n\n7.7.4 Tips on Arguments\n\nAlways look up a built-in function to see the arguments you can use.\nArguments are always named when you define a function.\nWhen you call a function, you do not have to specify the name of the argument.\nArguments have default values, which is used if you do not specify a value for that argument yourself.\nAn argument list comprises of comma-separated values that contain the various formal arguments.\nDefault arguments are specified as follows: parameter = expression\n\n\ny &lt;- 10:20\nsort(y)\n\n [1] 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n\nsort(y, decreasing = FALSE)\n\n [1] 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n\n\n\n\n7.7.5 Install Packages\n\nIn R, a package is a collection of functions, data, and documentation bundled together to perform specific tasks. Packages extend the capabilities of base R by providing tools for specialized analyses, graphics, data manipulation, machine learning, and much more.\n\nOption 1: Run install.packages(“tidyverse”) in the Console\nOption 2: Go to: Tools → Install Packages\n\nType the package name in the dialog box.\nMake sure Repository (CRAN) is selected.\nClick Install.\n\n\nOnce installed, you can load the package with: library(tidyverse).\nYou only need to install once, but you should load with library() every time you use it in a new session.\n\n\n\n7.7.6 Accessing Functions from Libraries\n\nTo use functions from a package like dplyr, you can either:\n\nLoad the library\n\n\ndata(mtcars)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nfunctionexample &lt;- filter(mtcars, mpg &gt; 20)\n\n\nUse the function explicitly, where explicit use of libraries means calling a function by prefixing it with the package name and ::\n\n\n\nfunctionexample &lt;- dplyr::filter(mtcars, mpg &gt; 20)\n\n\nIn other words, we use :: when you only need one function or want to avoid loading the full package.\n\n\n\n7.7.7 Note on Libraries\n\nSome libraries are part of other global libraries:\n\ndplyr and ggplot2 are part of tidyverse, there is actually no need to activate dplyr or ggplot2 if tidyverse is active, however, sometimes it helps when conflicts are present.\nAn example of a conflict is the use of a select function which shows up in both the dplyr and MASS package.

    "text": "7.10 Entering and Loading Data\n\n7.10.1 Creating a Vector\n\nA vector is the simplest type of data structure in R.\n\nA vector is a set of data elements that are saved together as the same type.\nWe have many ways to create vectors with some examples below.\n\nUse c() function, which is a generic function which combines its arguments into a vector or list.\n\n\nc(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  #Print a Vector 1:5\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\n\nIf numbers are aligned, can use the “:“ symbol to include numbers and all in between. This is considered an array.\n\n\n1:5  #Print a Vector 1:5\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\n\nUse seq() function to make a vector given a sequence.\n\n\nseq(from = 0, to = 30, by = 5)  #Creates a sequence vector from 0 to 30 in increments on 5 \n\n[1]  0  5 10 15 20 25 30\n\n\n\nUse rep() function to repeat the elements of a vector.\n\n\nrep(x = 1:3, times = 4)  #Repeat the elements of the vector 4 times\n\n [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3\n\nrep(x = 1:3, each = 3)  #Repeat the elements of a vector 3 times each\n\n[1] 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3\n\n\n\n\n7.10.2 Creating a Matrix\n\nA matrix is another type of object like a vector or a list.\n\nA matrix has a rectangular format with rows and columns.\nA matrix uses matrix() function\nYou can include the byrow = argument to tell the function whether to fill across or down first.\nYou can also include the dimnames() function in addition to the matrix() to assign names to rows and columns.\n\nUsing matrix() function, we can create a matrix with 3 rows and 3 columns as shown below.\n\nTake note how the matrix fills in the new data.\n\n\n# Creating a Variable X that has 9 Values.\nx &lt;- 1:9\n# Setting the matrix.\nmatrix(x, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    4    7\n[2,]    2    5    8\n[3,]    3    6    9\n\n# Note – we do not need to name the arguments because we go in the\n# correct order.  The function below simplifies the statement and\n# provides the same answer as above.\nmatrix(x, 3, 3)\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    4    7\n[2,]    2    5    8\n[3,]    3    6    9\n\n\n\n\n7.10.2.1 Setting More Arguments in a Matrix\n\nThe byrow argument fills the Matrix across the row\nBelow, we can use the byrow statement and assign it to a variable m.\n\n\nm &lt;- matrix(1:9, 3, 3, byrow = TRUE)  #Fills the Matrix Across the Row and assigns it to variable m\nm  #Printing the matrix in the console\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    2    3\n[2,]    4    5    6\n[3,]    7    8    9\n\n\n\nThe dimnames() function adds labels to either the row and the column. In this case below both are added to our matrix m.\n\n\ndimnames(x = m) &lt;- list(c(\"2020\", \"2021\", \"2022\"), c(\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\"))\nm  #Printing the matrix in the console\n\n     low medium high\n2020   1      2    3\n2021   4      5    6\n2022   7      8    9\n\n\n\nYou try to make a matrix of 25 items, or a 5 by 5, and fill the matrix across the row and assign the matrix to the name m2.\nYou should get the answer below.\n\n\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]\n[1,]    1    2    3    4    5\n[2,]    6    7    8    9   10\n[3,]   11   12   13   14   15\n[4,]   16   17   18   19   20\n[5,]   21   22   23   24   25\n\n\n\n\n7.10.2.2 Cbind and Rbind\n\nThe rbind() and cbind() functions in R are used to combine vectors, matrices, or data frames by rows (rbind) or columns (cbind), respectively, to form a larger matrix or data frame.\n\ncbind() joins vectors side by side (as columns).\nrbind() joins vectors on top of each other (as rows).\nBoth functions require vectors of equal length.\n\n\n# Vectors to use\na &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)\nb &lt;- c(4, 5, 6)\n\n# Combine as columns (column-bind)\nmatrix_cbind &lt;- cbind(a, b)\nmatrix_cbind\n\n     a b\n[1,] 1 4\n[2,] 2 5\n[3,] 3 6\n\n# Combine as rows (row-bind)\nmatrix_rbind &lt;- rbind(a, b)\nmatrix_rbind\n\n  [,1] [,2] [,3]\na    1    2    3\nb    4    5    6\n\n\n\n\n\n7.10.2.3 Differences between Data Frames and Matrices\n\nIn a data frame the columns contain different types of data, but in a matrix all the elements are the same type of data. A matrix is usually numbers.\nA matrix can be looked at as a vector with additional methods or dimensions, while a data frame is a list.\n\n\n\n\n7.10.3 Creating a Data Frame\n\nA data frame is a table or a two-dimensional array-like structure in which each column contains values of one variable and each row contains one set of values from each column. In a data frame the rows are observations and columns are variables.\n\nData frames are generic data objects to store tabular data.\nThe column names should be non-empty.\nThe row names should be unique.\nThe data stored in a data frame can be of numeric, factor or character type.\nEach column should contain same number of data items.\nCombing vectors into a data frame using the data.frame() function\n\nBelow, we can create vectors for state, year enacted, personal oz limit medical marijuana.\n\n\nstate &lt;- c(\"Alaska\", \"Arizona\", \"Arkansas\")\nyear.legal &lt;- c(1998, 2010, 2016)\nounce.lim &lt;- c(1, 2.5, 3)\n\n\nThen, we can combine the 3 vectors into a data frame and name the data frame pot.legal.\n\n\npot.legal &lt;- data.frame(state, year.legal, ounce.lim)\n\n\nNext, check your global environment to confirm data frame was created.\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Environment\n\n\n\n\n7.10.4 Importing a Data Frame into R\n\nWhen importing data from outside sources, you can do the following:\n\n\nYou can import data from an R package using data() function.\nYou can also link directly to a file on the web.\nYou can import data through from your computer through common file extensions:\n\n.csv: comma separated values;\n.txt: text file;\n.xls or .xlsx: Excel file;\n.sav: SPSS file;\n.sasb7dat: SAS file;\n.xpt: SAS transfer file;\n.dta: Stata file.\n\n\n\nEach different file type requires a unique function to read in the file. With all the variety in file types, it is best to look it up in the R Community to help.\n\n\n7.10.4.1 Use data() function\n\nAll we need is the data() function to read in a data set that is part of R. R has many built in libraries now, so there are many data sets we can use for testing and learning statistics in R.\n\n\n# The mtcars data set is part of R, so no new package needs to be\n# downloaded.\ndata(\"mtcars\")\n\n\nLoad a data frame from a unique package in R.\n\nThere are also a lot of packages that house data sets. It is fairly easy to make a package that contains data and load it into CRAN. These packages need to be installed into your R one time. Then, each time you open R, you need to reload the library using the library() function.\nWhen your run the install.packages() function, do not include the # symbol. Then, after you run it one time, comment it out. There is no need to run this code a second time unless something happens to your RStudio.\n\n\n# install.packages('MASS') #only need to install package one time in\n# R\nlibrary(MASS)\n\n\n\ndata(\"Insurance\")\nhead(Insurance)\n\n  District  Group   Age Holders Claims\n1        1    &lt;1l   &lt;25     197     38\n2        1    &lt;1l 25-29     264     35\n3        1    &lt;1l 30-35     246     20\n4        1    &lt;1l   &gt;35    1680    156\n5        1 1-1.5l   &lt;25     284     63\n6        1 1-1.5l 25-29     536     84\n\n\n\n\n7.10.4.2 Accessing Variables\n\nYou can directly access a variable from a dataset using the $ symbol followed by the variable name.\nThe $ symbol facilitates data manipulation operations by allowing easy access to variables for calculations, transformations, or other analyses. For example:\n\n\nhead(Insurance$Claims)  #lists the first 6 Claims in the Insurance dataset.\n\n[1]  38  35  20 156  63  84\n\nsd(Insurance$Claims)  #provides the standard deviation of all Claims in the Insurance dataset.\n\n[1] 71.1624",

    "section": "3.2 Summarizing Quantitative Data",
    "text": "3.2 Summarizing Quantitative Data\n\n3.2.1 Defining and Calculating Central Tendency\n\nThe term central location refers to how numerical data tend to cluster around some middle or central value.\nMeasures of central location attempt to find a typical or central value that describes a variable.\nWhy frequency distributions do not work for numeric variables:\n\nNumeric variables measured on a continuum.\nInstead, we calculate descriptive statistics including central tendency and spread of the values for a numeric variable.\n\nWe will examine the three mostly widely used measures of central location: mean, median and mode.\nThen we discuss a percentile: a measure of relative position.\n\n\n3.2.1.1 Using the Mean\n\nThe arithmetic mean or simply the mean is a primary measure of central location. It is often referred to as the average. Simply add up all the observations and divide by the number of observations.\nThe numerator (top of the fraction) is the sum (sigma) of all the values of x from the first value (i = 1) to the last value (n) divided by the number of values (n).\n\\(m_x = (\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i})/n\\)\nConsider the salaries of employees at a company: \nWe can use the mean() command to calculate the mean in R.\n\n\n# Create Vector of Salaries\nsalaries &lt;- c(40000, 40000, 65000, 90000, 145000, 150000, 550000)\n# Calculate the mean using the mean() command\nmean(salaries)\n\n[1] 154285.7\n\n\n\nNote that due to at least one outlier this mean does not reflect the typical salary - more on that later.\nIf we edit our vector to include NAs, we have to account for this. This is a common way to handle NAs in functions that do not allow for them.\n\n\nsalaries2 &lt;- c(40000, 40000, 65000, 90000, 145000, 150000, 550000, NA,\n    NA)\n# Calculate the mean using the mean() command Notice that it does not\n# work\nmean(salaries2)\n\n[1] NA\n\n# Add in na.rm parameter to get it to produce the mean with no NAs.\nmean(salaries2, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 154285.7\n\n\n\nNote that there are other types of means like the weighted mean or the geometric mean.\n\nThe weighted mean uses weights to determine the importance of each data point of a variable. It is calculated by \\(\\bar{x}_w = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}\\), where are the weights associated to the values.\nAn example is below.\n\n\nvalues &lt;- c(4, 7, 10, 5, 6)\nweights &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nweighted_mean &lt;- weighted.mean(values, weights)\nweighted_mean\n\n[1] 6.533333\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1.2 Using the Median\n\nThe median is another measure of central location that is not affected by outliers.\nWhen the data are arranged in ascending order, the median is:\n\nThe middle value if the number of observations is odd, or\nThe average of the two middle values if the number of observations is even.\n\nConsider the sorted salaries of employees presented earlier which contains an odd number of observations.\n\nOn the same salaries vector created above, use median() command to calculate the median in R.\n\n\n# Calculate the median using the median() command\nmedian(salaries)\n\n[1] 90000\n\n\n\nNow compare to the mean and note the large difference in numbers signifying that at least one outlier is most likely present.\nSpecifically, if the mean and median are different, it is likely the variable is skewed and contains outliers.\n\n\nmean(salaries)\n\n[1] 154285.7\n\n\n\nFor another example, consider the sorted data below that contains an even number of values.\n\n\nGrowthFund &lt;- c(-38.32, 1.71, 3.17, 5.99, 12.56, 13.47, 16.89, 16.96, 32.16,\n    36.29)\n\n\nWhen data contains an even number of values, the median is the average of the 2 sorted middle numbers (12.56 and 13.47).\n\n\nmedian(GrowthFund)\n\n[1] 13.015\n\n(12.56 + 13.47)/2\n\n[1] 13.015\n\n# The mean is still the average\nmean(GrowthFund)\n\n[1] 10.088\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1.3 Using the Mode\n\nThe mode is another measure of central location.\nThe mode is the most frequently occurring value in a data set.\nThe mode is useful in summarizing categorical data but can also be used to summarize quantitative data.\nA data set can have no mode, one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal) or many modes (multimodal).\nThe mode is less useful when there are more than three modes.\n\n\n\n3.2.1.4 Example of Function with Salary Variable\n\nWhile this is a small vector, when working with a large dataset and a function like sort(x = table(salaries), decreasing = TRUE), appending [1:5] is a way to focus on the top results after the frequencies have been computed and sorted. Specifically, table(salaries) calculates the frequency of each unique salary, sort(…, decreasing = TRUE) orders these frequencies from highest to lowest, and [1:5] selects the first five entries in the sorted list. This is useful when the dataset contains many unique values, as it allows you to quickly identify and extract the top 5 most frequent salaries, providing a concise summary without being overwhelmed by the full distribution.\nConsider the salary of employees presented earlier. 40,000 appears 2 times and is the mode because that occurs most often.\n\n\n# Try this command with and without it.\nsort(x = table(salaries), decreasing = TRUE)[1:5]\n\nsalaries\n 40000  65000  90000 145000 150000 \n     2      1      1      1      1 \n\n\n\n\n3.2.1.5 Finding No Mode\n\nLook at the sort(table()) commands with the GrowthFund Vector we made earlier.\nI added a 1:5 in square brackets at the end of the statement to produce the 3 highest frequencies found in the vector.\n\n\nsort(table(GrowthFund), decreasing = TRUE)[1:5]\n\nGrowthFund\n-38.32   1.71   3.17   5.99  12.56 \n     1      1      1      1      1 \n\n\n\nEven if you use this command, you still need to evaluate the data more systematically to verify the mode. If the highest frequency of the sorted table is 1, then there is no mode.",

    "text": "3.3 Defining and Calculating Spread\n\nSpread is a measure of distance values are from the central value.\nEach measure of central tendency has one or more corresponding measures of spread.\nMean: use variance or standard deviation to measure spread.\n\nskewness and kurtosis help measure spread as well.\n\nMedian: use range or interquartile range (IQR) to measure spread.\nMode: use the index of qualitative variation to measure spread.\n\nNot formally testing here with a function.\n\n\n\n3.3.1 Spread to Report with the Mean\n\n3.3.1.1 Evaluating Skewness\n\nSkewness is a measure of the extent to which a distribution is skewed.\nCan evaluate skewness visually with histogram.\n\nA histogram is a visual representation of a frequency or a relative frequency distribution.\nBar height represents the respective class frequency (or relative frequency).\nBar width represents the class width.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluating Skewness Visually\n\n\n\n\n3.3.1.2 Skewed Distributions: Median Not Same as Mean\n\nSometimes, a histogram is difficult to tell if skewness is present or if the data is relatively normal or symmetric.\nIf Mean is less than Median and Mode, then the variable is Left-Skewed.\nIf the Mean is greater than the Median and Mode, then the variable is Right-Skewed.\nIf the Mean is about equal to the Median and Mode, then the variable has a symmetric distribution.\nIn R, we can easily look at mean and median with the summary() command.\n\n\n\n\nEvaluating Skewness Using Mean and Median\n\n\n\nMean is great when data are normally distributed (data is not skewed).\nMean is not a good representation of skewed data where outliers are present.\n\nAdding together a set of values that includes a few very large or very small values like those on the far left of a left-skewed distribution or the far right of the right-skewed distribution will result in a large or small total value in the numerator of Equation and therefore the mean will be a large or small value relative to the actual middle of the data.\n\nThere are a number of ways to check for skewness, two functions are below.The skewness() function from the e1071 package and the skew() function from the semTools package both measure skewness, but they differ slightly in how they scale the result.\nBy default, e1071::skewness() uses a sample-based formula (dividing by \\(n\\)). In contrast, semTools::skew() uses Mardia’s definition and is more commonly applied in structural equation modeling contexts.\nAs a result, the values may differ slightly, especially for small samples or skewed distributions. Both are valid but should be used consistently depending on the analytical context.\n\n\n\n3.3.1.3 Using skewness command from e1071\n\nA standard calculation of skewness using the mean is based on the third standardized moment of a distribution. The formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Skewness} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{x_i - \\bar{x}}{s} \\right)^3\n\\] * where \\(x_i\\) = each observation * \\(\\bar{x}\\) = sample mean * \\(s\\) = sample standard deviation * \\(n\\) = sample size * This formula measures the asymmetry of the distribution: + Positive skew (right-skewed): longer tail on the right + Negative skew (left-skewed): longer tail on the left + Zero skew: symmetric distribution\n\ne1071::skewness(salaries)\n\n[1] 1.415062\n\n## a positive number indicates a longer tail to the right.\n\n\n\n3.3.1.4 Using skew() Command from semTools\n\nWe will use the skew() command is from the semTools package.\nThe install.packages() command is commented out below, but install it one time on your R before commenting it out.\n\n\n# install the semTools package if necessary.\n# install.packages('semTools') Activate the library\nlibrary(semTools)\n\n\nAfter the package is installed and loaded, run the skew() command on the salaries vector made above.\n\n\nskew(salaries)\n\nskew (g1)        se         z         p \n    2.311     0.926     2.496     0.013 \n\n\n\n\n3.3.1.5 Interpreting the skew() Command Results\n\nse = standard error\nz = skew/se\nIf the sample size is small (n &lt; 50), z values outside the –2 to 2 range are a problem.\nIf the sample size is between 50 and 300, z values outside the –3.29 to 3.29 range are a problem.\nFor large samples (n &gt; 300), using a visual is recommended over the statistics, but generally z values outside the range of –7 to 7 can be considered problematic.\nSalary: Our sample size was small, &lt;50, so the z value of 2.496 in regards to the salary vector indicates there is a problem with skewness.\nGrowthFund: We can check the skew of GrowthFund.\n\n\nskew(GrowthFund)\n\nskew (g1)        se         z         p \n   -1.381     0.775    -1.783     0.075 \n\n\n\nGrowthFund was also considered a small sample size, so the same -2/2 thresholds are used. Here, our z value is -1.78250137, which is in normal range. This indicates there is no problem with skewness.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Histograms\n\nA histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of numerical data.\nIt consists of a series of contiguous rectangles, or bars, where the area of each bar corresponds to the frequency of observations within a particular range or bin of values.\nThe x-axis typically represents the range of values being measured, while the y-axis represents the frequency or count of observations falling within each range.\nHistograms are commonly used in statistics and data analysis to visualize the distribution of a dataset and identify patterns or trends.\nThey are particularly useful for understanding the central tendency, variability, and shape of the data distribution - this includes our observation of skewness.\nWorks much better with larger datsets.\n\n\n3.3.2.1 Commands to Make a Histogram\n\nhist() command in base R.\ngeom_histogram() command in ggplot2 package.\na hist using the GrowthFund dataset does not look that great because its sample size is so small.\n\n\nhist(GrowthFund)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2.2 hist vs geom_histogram\n\nIn R, hist() and geom_histogram() are both used to create histograms, but they belong to different packages and have slightly different functionalities.\n\n\n# Making an appropriate data.frame to use the hist() command\nHousePrice &lt;- c(430, 520, 460, 475, 670, 521, 670, 417, 533, 525, 538,\n    370, 530, 525, 430, 330, 575, 555, 521, 350, 399, 560, 440, 425, 669,\n    660, 702, 540, 460, 588, 445, 412, 735, 537, 630, 430)\nHousePrice &lt;- data.frame(HousePrice)\n\n\nhist(): This function is from the base R graphics package and is used to create histograms. It provides a simple way to visualize the distribution of a single variable.\n\n\n# Using base R to create the histogram.\nhist(HousePrice$HousePrice, breaks = 5, main = \"A Histogram\", xlab = \"House Prices (in $1,000s)\",\n    col = \"yellow\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\ngeom_histogram(): This function is from the ggplot2 package, which is part of the tidyverse. It is used to create histograms as part of a more flexible and powerful plotting system.\n\n\n# Using geom_histogram() command to create the histogram.\nggplot(HousePrice, aes(x = HousePrice)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 100,\n    boundary = 300, color = \"black\", fill = \"yellow\") + labs(title = \"A Histogram\",\n    x = \"House Prices (in $1,000s)\", y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could add more parameters here to make the 2 histograms look identical, but this configuration of parameters is very close. Take note that there are a lot more parameters you can add to the geom_histogram() command than you can with base R to make it look more professional. Be sure to look them up and also check with the notes in the book, which focuses on geom_histogram instead of hist().\nVariance is a measure of spread for numeric variables that is essentially the average of the squared differences between each observation value on some variable and the mean for that variable with population variance. \\[Population Var(X) = \\sigma^2 = \\sum{(x_i-\\mu)^2}/N\\] \\[Sample Var(x) = s^2 = \\sum{(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}/(n-1)\\]\nStandard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n\nUse var() command and sd() command to calculate sample variance and sample standard deviation.\n\n\n\n## Calculated from Small Sample\nx &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nsum((x - mean(x))^2/(5 - 1))\n\n[1] 2.5\n\nvar(x)\n\n[1] 2.5\n\nsqrt(var(x))\n\n[1] 1.581139\n\nsd(x)\n\n[1] 1.581139\n\nsd(HousePrice$HousePrice)  #102.6059\n\n[1] 102.6059\n\nvar(HousePrice$HousePrice)  #10527.97\n\n[1] 10527.97\n\nskew(HousePrice$HousePrice)  #normal\n\nskew (g1)        se         z         p \n    0.317     0.408     0.777     0.437 \n\n\nLooking at Spread for a Larger Dataset\n\n\ncustomers &lt;- read.csv(\"data/customers.csv\")\nsummary(customers$Spending, na.rm = TRUE)  #mean and median\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Positive values will be indicative to a leptokurtic distribution and negative will indicate a platykurtic distribution. To see if kurtosis (leptokurtic or platykurtic) is significant, we confirm them by first evaluating the z-score to see if the variable is normal or not. The same cutoff values from skew also apply for the z for small, medium, and large sample sizes in kurtosis. These are the same basic rules for the rules in judging skewness.\n\n\n\n\nEvaluate Kurtosis\n\n\n\nThe rules of determining problematic distributions with regards to kurtosis are below.\n\nIf the sample size is small (n &lt; 50), z values outside the –2 to 2 range are a problem.\nIf the sample size is between 50 and 300, z values outside the –3.29 to 3.29 range are a problem.\nFor large samples (n &gt; 300), using a visual is recommended over the statistics, but generally z values outside the range of –7 to 7 can be considered problematic.\nIf kurtosis is found, then evaluate the excess kur score to see if it is positive or negative to determine whether it is leptokurtic or platykurtic.\n\n\n\n# z-value is 3.0398, which is &gt; 2 indicating leptokurtic Small sample\n# size: range is -2 to 2\nkurtosis(salaries)\n\nExcess Kur (g2)              se               z               p \n          5.629           1.852           3.040           0.002 \n\n# z-value is 2.20528007, which is &gt; 2 indicating leptokurtic Small\n# sample size: range is -2 to 2\nkurtosis(GrowthFund)\n\nExcess Kur (g2)              se               z               p \n          3.416           1.549           2.205           0.027 \n\n# Small sample size: range is -2 to 2 Skewness and kurtosis are both\n# in range.\nskew(HousePrice$HousePrice)  #normal\n\nskew (g1)        se         z         p \n    0.317     0.408     0.777     0.437 \n\nkurtosis(HousePrice$HousePrice)  #normal\n\nExcess Kur (g2)              se               z               p \n         -0.540           0.816          -0.661           0.508 \n\n\n\nLet’s do a few more examples using the customers dataset.\n\n\n# Noted sample size at 200 observations or a medium sample size.\n# Using threshold –3.29 to 3.29 to assess normality.\n\n#-3.4245446445 is below -3.29 so kurtosis is present\n# Negative kurtosis value indicates platykurtic\nkurtosis(customers$Spending)\n\nExcess Kur (g2)              se               z               p \n         -1.186           0.346          -3.425           0.001 \n\ngeom_histogram(binwidth = 100, fill = \"pink\", color = \"black\")\n\ngeom_bar: na.rm = FALSE, orientation = NA\nstat_bin: binwidth = 100, bins = NULL, na.rm = FALSE, orientation = NA, pad = FALSE\nposition_stack \n\nsemTools::skew(customers$Spending)  ##normal indicating no skewness\n\nskew (g1)        se         z         p \n   -0.018     0.173    -0.106     0.916 \n\n# Normal: 2.977622119 is in between -3.29 and 3.29\nkurtosis(customers$Income)\n\nExcess Kur (g2)              se               z               p \n          1.031           0.346           2.978           0.003 \n\nggplot(customers, aes(Income)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 10000, fill = \"pink\",\n    color = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsemTools::skew(customers$Income)  #Skewed right\n\nskew (g1)        se         z         p \n    0.874     0.173     5.047     0.000 \n\n#-3.7251961028 is below -3.29 so kurtosis is present\n# Negative kurtosis value indicates platykurtic\nkurtosis(customers$HHSize)\n\nExcess Kur (g2)              se               z               p \n         -1.290           0.346          -3.725           0.000 \n\nggplot(customers, aes(HHSize)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = \"pink\",\n    color = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsemTools::skew(customers$HHSize)  #normal\n\nskew (g1)        se         z         p \n   -0.089     0.173    -0.513     0.608 \n\n# Normal: -0.20056607 is in between -3.29 and 3.29\nkurtosis(customers$Orders)\n\nExcess Kur (g2)              se               z               p \n         -0.069           0.346          -0.201           0.841 \n\ngeom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"pink\", color = \"black\")\n\ngeom_bar: na.rm = FALSE, orientation = NA\nstat_bin: binwidth = 5, bins = NULL, na.rm = FALSE, orientation = NA, pad = FALSE\nposition_stack \n\nsemTools::skew(customers$Orders)  ##skewed right\n\nskew (g1)        se         z         p \n    0.789     0.173     4.553     0.000 \n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Spread to Report with the Median\n\nRange = Maximum Value – Minimum Value.\n\nSimplest measure.\nFocuses on Extreme values.\nUse commands diff(range()) or max() – min().\n\nIQR: Difference between the first and third quartiles.\n\nUse IQR() command or quantile() command.\n\n\nsummary(customers$Spending, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Sometimes when you read in data it is in the correct type, and other times, you need to force it into the type you need to conduct the analysis through a process called coercion.\n\nFactor (Nominal or Ordinal)\nNumeric (Real or Discrete (Integer))\nCharacter\nLogical\nDate",

    "text": "6.1 Common dplyr Functions\n\n6.1.1 Arrange\n\nSorting or arranging the dataset allows you to specify an order based on variable values.\nSorting allows us to review the range of values for each variable, and we can sort based on a single or multiple variables.\nNotice the difference between sort() and arrange() functions below.\n\nThe sort() function sorts a vector.\nThe arrange() function sorts a dataset based on a variable.\n\nTo conduct an example, read in the data set called gig.csv from your working directory.\n\n\ngig &lt;- read.csv(\"data/gig.csv\", stringsAsFactors = TRUE, na.strings = \"\")\ndim(gig)\n\n[1] 604   4\n\nhead(gig)\n\n  EmployeeID  Wage     Industry        Job\n1          1 32.81 Construction    Analyst\n2          2 46.00   Automotive   Engineer\n3          3 43.13 Construction  Sales Rep\n4          4 48.09   Automotive      Other\n5          5 43.62   Automotive Accountant\n6          6 46.98 Construction   Engineer\n\n\n\nUsing the arrange() function, we add the dataset, followed by a comma and then add in the variable we want to sort. This arranges from small to large.\nBelow is code to rearrange data based on Wage and save it in a new object.\n\n\nsortTidy &lt;- arrange(gig, Wage)\nhead(sortTidy)\n\n  EmployeeID  Wage     Industry        Job\n1        467 24.28 Construction   Engineer\n2        547 24.28 Construction  Sales Rep\n3        580 24.28 Construction Accountant\n4        559 24.42 Construction   Engineer\n5         16 24.76   Automotive Programmer\n6        221 24.76   Automotive Programmer\n\n\n\nWe can apply a desc() function inside the arrange function to re-sort from high to low like shown below.\n\n\nsortTidyDesc &lt;- arrange(gig, desc(Wage))\nhead(sortTidyDesc)\n\n  EmployeeID  Wage     Industry        Job\n1        110 51.00 Construction      Other\n2         79 50.00   Automotive   Engineer\n3        348 49.91 Construction Accountant\n4        373 49.91 Construction Accountant\n5        599 49.84   Automotive   Engineer\n6         70 49.77 Construction Accountant\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Subsetting or Filtering\n\nSubsetting or filtering a data frame is the process of indexing, or extracting a portion of the data set that is relevant for subsequent statistical analysis. Subsetting allows you to work with a subset of your data, which is essential for data analysis and manipulation. One of the most common ways to subset in R is by using square brackets []. We can also use the filter() function from tidyverse.\nWe use subsets to do the following:\n\nView data based on specific data values or ranges.\nCompare two or more subsets of the data.\nEliminate observations that contain missing values, low-quality data, or outliers.\nExclude variables that contain redundant information, or variables with excessive amounts of missing values.\n\nWhen working with data frames, you can subset by rows and columns using two indices inside the square brackets: data[row, column]. For example, if you have df &lt;- data.frame(a = 1:3, b = c(“X”, “Y”, “Z”)), df[1, 2] would return the value “X”, which is the first row and second column. If you want the entire first row, you would use df[1, ], and to get the second column, you’d use df[, 2].\nYou can also use logical conditions to subset. For instance, x[x &gt; 20] would return all values in x greater than 20, and in a data frame, you could filter rows where a certain condition holds, such as df[df$a &gt; 1, ], which returns rows where column a has values greater than 1.\nLet’s do an example using the customers.csv file we read in earlier as customers in the last lesson. Base R provides several methods for subsetting data structures. Below uses base R by using the square brackets dataset[row, column] format.\n\n\ncustomers &lt;- read.csv(\"data/customers.csv\", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)\n\n# To subset, note the dataset[row,column] format Results hidden to\n# save space, but be sure to try this code in your .R file.  Data in\n# 1st row\ncustomers[1, ]\n# Data in 2nd column\ncustomers[, 2]\n# Data for 2nd column/1st observation (row)\ncustomers[1, 2]\n# First 3 columns of data\ncustomers[, 1:3]\n\n\nOne of the most powerful and intuitive ways to subset data frames in R is by using the filter() function from the dplyr package, which is part of the tidyverse. Tidyverse is extremely popular when filtering data.\nThe filter function is used to subset rows of a data frame based on certain conditions.\nThe below example filters data by the College variable when category values are “Yes” and saves the filtered dataset into an object called college.\n\n\n# Filtering by whether the customer has a 'Yes' for college.  Saving\n# this filter into a new object college which you should see in your\n# global environment.\ncollege &lt;- filter(customers, College == \"Yes\")\n# Showing first 6 records of college - note the College variable is\n# all Yes's.\nhead(college)\n\n   CustID    Sex     Race  BirthDate College HHSize Income Spending Orders\n1 1530016 Female    Black 12/16/1986     Yes      5  53000      241      3\n2 1531136   Male    White   5/9/1993     Yes      5  94000      843     12\n3 1532160   Male    Black  5/22/1966     Yes      2  64000      719      9\n4 1532307   Male    White  9/16/1964     Yes      4  60000      582     13\n5 1532387   Male    White  8/27/1957     Yes      2  67000      452      9\n6 1533017 Female Hispanic  5/14/1985     Yes      3  84000      153      2\n  Channel\n1      SM\n2      TV\n3      TV\n4      SM\n5      SM\n6     Web\n\n\n\nUsing the filter command, we can add filters pretty easily by using an & for and, or an | for or. The statement below filters by College and Income and save the new dataset in an object called twoFilters.\n\n\ntwoFilters &lt;- filter(customers, College == \"Yes\" & Income &lt; 50000)\nhead(twoFilters)\n\n   CustID    Sex     Race  BirthDate College HHSize Income Spending Orders\n1 1533697 Female    Asian  10/8/1974     Yes      3  42000      247      3\n2 1535063 Female    White 12/17/1982     Yes      3  42000      313      4\n3 1544417   Male Hispanic  3/14/1980     Yes      4  46000      369      3\n4 1547864 Female Hispanic  6/15/1987     Yes      2  44000      500      5\n5 1550969 Female    White   4/8/1978     Yes      4  47000      774     16\n6 1553660 Female    White   8/2/1988     Yes      2  47000      745      5\n  Channel\n1     Web\n2      TV\n3      TV\n4      TV\n5      TV\n6      SM\n\n\n\nNext, we can do an or statement. The example below uses the filter command to filter by more than one category in the same field using the | in between the categories.\n\n\nTwoRaces &lt;- filter(customers, Race == \"Black\" | Race == \"White\")\nhead(TwoRaces)\n\n   CustID    Sex  Race  BirthDate College HHSize Income Spending Orders Channel\n1 1530016 Female Black 12/16/1986     Yes      5  53000      241      3      SM\n2 1531136   Male White   5/9/1993     Yes      5  94000      843     12      TV\n3 1532160   Male Black  5/22/1966     Yes      2  64000      719      9      TV\n4 1532307   Male White  9/16/1964     Yes      4  60000      582     13      SM\n5 1532387   Male White  8/27/1957     Yes      2  67000      452      9      SM\n6 1533791   Male White 10/27/1999     Yes      1  97000     1028     17     Web\n\n\n\nThe str_detect() function is used to detect the presence or absence of a pattern (regular expression) in a string or vector of strings. It returns a logical vector indicating whether the pattern was found in each element of the input vector.\nUsing str_detect it with a filter function allows you to pull observations based on the inclusion of a string pattern.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nBirthday2000 &lt;- filter(customers, str_detect(BirthDate, \"1985\"))\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Select\n\nIn R, the select() function is part of the dplyr package, which is used for data manipulation. The select() function is specifically designed to subset or choose specific columns from a data frame. It allows you to select variables (columns) by their names or indices.\nBoth statements below select Income, Spending, and Orders variables from the customers dataset and form them into a new dataset called smallData.\nThe statements are written with and without the chaining operator.\n\n\nsmallData &lt;- select(customers, Income, Spending, Orders)\nhead(smallData)\n\n  Income Spending Orders\n1  53000      241      3\n2  94000      843     12\n3  64000      719      9\n4  60000      582     13\n5  47000      845      7\n6  67000      452      9\n\n\n\n\n6.1.4 Piping (Chaining) Operator\n\nThe pipe operator takes the output of the expression on its left-hand side and passes it as the first argument to the function on its right-hand side. This enables you to chain multiple functions together, making the code easier to understand and debug.\nIf we want to keep our code tidy, we can add the piping operator (%&gt;%) to help combine our lines of code into a new object or overwriting the same object.\nThis operator allows us to pass the result of one function/argument to the other one in sequence.\nThe below example uses a select function to pull Income, Spending, and Orders variables fromt he customers dataset and save it as a new object called smallData. It is an identical request to the one directly above, but written with the piping operator.\n\n\nsmallData &lt;- customers %&gt;%\n    select(Income, Spending, Orders)\n\n\n\n6.1.5 Counting\n\nCounting allows us to gain a better understanding and insights into the data.\nThis helps to verify that the data set is complete or determine if there are missing values.\nIn R, the length() function returns the number of elements in a vector, list, or any other object with a length attribute. It essentially counts the number of elements in the specified object.\n\n\n# Gives the length of Industry\nlength(gig$Industry)\n\n[1] 604\n\n\n\nFor counting using tidyverse, we typically use the filter and count function together to filter by a value or state and then count the filtered data.\nIn the function below, I use the piping operator to link together the filter and count functions into one command.\nNote that we need a piping operator (%&gt;%) before each new function that is part of the chunk.\n\n\n# Counting with a Categorical Variable Here we are filtering by\n# Automotive Industry and then counting the number and saving it in a\n# new object called countAuto\ncountAuto &lt;- gig %&gt;%\n    filter(Industry == \"Automotive\") %&gt;%\n    count()\ncountAuto  #190\n\n    n\n1 190\n\n\n\nBelow, we are filtering by Wage and the counting.\n\n\n# Counting with a Numerical Variable We could also save this in an\n# object.\ngig %&gt;%\n    filter(Wage &gt; 30) %&gt;%\n    count()  ##536\n\n    n\n1 536\n\n\n\nWe learned that there are 190 employees in the automotive industry and there are 536 employees who earn more than $30 per hour.\nWe could also calculate the number of people with wages under or equal to 30.\n\n\n# We find 68 Wages under or equal to 30\nWageLess30 &lt;- gig %&gt;%\n    filter(Wage &lt;= 30) %&gt;%\n    count()  #\nWageLess30\n\n   n\n1 68\n\n\n\nHow many Accountants are there in the Job Category of the gig data set. The answer is shown below. Use filter and count to calculate this answer.\n\n\n\n   n\n1 83\n\n\n\n\n6.1.6 Handling Missing Data\n\nMissing data is a common issue in data analysis and can arise for various reasons, such as data collection errors, non-responses in surveys, or data corruption. In R, handling missing data is crucial to ensure accurate and reliable analysis. Missing values are typically represented by NA (Not Available) in R.\nMissing data needs to be closely evaluated and verified within each variable whether the data is truly blank, has no answer, or is marked with a character value such as the text N/A.\nMissing data needs to be closely evaluated to see if the missing value is meaningful or not. If the variable that has many missing values is deemed unimportant or can be represented using a proxy variable that does not have missing values, the variable may be excluded from the analysis.\nAfter a data set is loaded, there are three common strategies for dealing with missing values.\n\n\nThe omission strategy recommends that observations with missing values be excluded from subsequent analysis.\nThe imputation strategy recommends that the missing values be replaced with some reasonable imputed values. For example, imputing missing values using techniques like mean/median substitution or regression models can be considered.\n\nNumeric variables: replace with the average.\nCategorical variables: replace with the predominant category.\n\nIgnore your missing data if the function works without it.\n\nWhen you ignore missing data because your function works without it, the missing values are typically excluded from the calculations by default. In R, many functions, such as mean(), sum(), or lm(), have arguments like na.rm = TRUE to explicitly remove missing values during computation. Ignoring missing data can simplify the analysis, but it comes with potential consequences.\n\n\n\nThe choice of approach depends on the nature of the missingness, which can be categorized as Missing Completely at Random, Missing at Random, or Missing Not at Random. Addressing missing data appropriately is essential to maintain the validity of statistical analyses and avoid biases.\n\n\n6.1.6.1 Limitations of Using a Missing Data Technique\n\nRecommended Closer Evaluation of Missing Data\nThere are limitations of the techniques listed above (omission, imputation, and ignore).\nReduction in Sample Size: Ignoring missing data leads to a smaller effective sample size, which may reduce the power of your analysis and the reliability of the results.\nBias: If the missing data are not Missing Completely at Random, ignoring them may introduce bias. For example, if specific groups or patterns are overrepresented in the remaining data, the results may not generalize to the full dataset.\nDistorted Metrics: Calculations that ignore missing values (e.g., averages, sums) might not reflect the true population parameters, especially if the missing data are systematically different from the observed data. In addition, if a large number of values are missing, mean imputation will likely distort the relationships among variables, leading to biased results.\nIncorrect Inferences: Ignoring missing data without considering its nature could lead to incorrect conclusions, as the analysis only reflects the subset of available data.\nConsider a dataset used to predict factors that lead to intubation due to COVID-19. Suppose one variable, “Number of pregnancies,” contains missing data (NAs) for all men, as the question is not applicable to them. If we were to compare this variable with another, “Intubated due to COVID-19: Yes/No,” simply omitting the rows with blanks (NAs) could lead to the exclusion of an entire gender, distorting the analysis. In this case, a different approach to handling missing data would be more appropriate to ensure the dataset remains representative. Additionally, if a value is not blank but is considered missing for analysis purposes, the data should be consistently processed (e.g., mutated or recoded) to align with the chosen technique for handling true missing values.\n\n\n\n6.1.6.2 na.rm\n\nThe na.rm parameter in R is a convenient way to handle missing values (NA) within functions that perform calculations on datasets. The parameter stands for “NA remove” and, when set to TRUE, instructs the function to exclude missing values from the computation.\n\n\ny &lt;- c(1, 2, NA, 3, 4, NA)\n# These lines runs, but do not give you anything useful.\nsum(y)\n\n[1] NA\n\nmean(y)\n\n[1] NA\n\n\n\nMany functions in R include parameters that will ignore NAs for you.\nsum() and mean() are examples of this, and most summary statistics like median() and var() and max() also use the na.rm parameter to ignore the NAs. Always check the help to determine if na.rm is a parameter.\n\n\nsum(y, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 10\n\nmean(y, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 2.5\n\n# na.omit removes the NAs from the vector of dataset. Here, it works\n# for removing NAs from the vector.\ny &lt;- na.omit(y)\n\n\n\n6.1.6.3 na.rm with a a dataset\n\nUsing a dataset, we need the _data\\(variable_ format, like mean(data\\)column, na.rm = TRUE) calculates the mean of the non-missing values in the specified column or variable. This approach is straightforward and useful when the presence of missing values would otherwise cause an error or return an NA result.\n\n\ngig &lt;- read.csv(\"data/gig.csv\", stringsAsFactors = TRUE, na.strings = \"\")\nsummary(gig)\n\n   EmployeeID         Wage               Industry           Job     \n Min.   :  1.0   Min.   :24.28   Automotive  :190   Engineer  :191  \n 1st Qu.:151.8   1st Qu.:34.19   Construction:366   Other     : 88  \n Median :302.5   Median :41.88   Tech        : 38   Accountant: 83  \n Mean   :302.5   Mean   :40.08   NA's        : 10   Programmer: 80  \n 3rd Qu.:453.2   3rd Qu.:45.87                      Sales Rep : 77  \n Max.   :604.0   Max.   :51.00                      (Other)   : 69  \n                                                    NA's      : 16  \n\nmean(gig$Wage, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 40.0828\n\n\n\n\n6.1.6.4 is.na()\n\nIn R, the is.na() function is used to check for missing (NA) values in objects like vectors, data frames, or arrays.

For example, summary(mtcars) provides the min, max, median, and mean for numeric columns and counts for factors. It’s useful for a broad snapshot of your dataset.\nIn contrast, summarize() (or summarise()) is from the dplyr package and allows for custom summaries. For instance, mtcars %&gt;% summarize(avg_mpg = mean(mpg), max_hp = max(hp)) returns the average miles per gallon and the maximum horsepower. It’s more flexible and is often used with group_by() for grouped calculations. In conclusion, summary() gives automatic overviews, while summarize() is better for tailored summaries.\nIn the example below, we can summarize more than one thing into tidy output.\n\n\ngig %&gt;%\n    drop_na() %&gt;%\n    summarize(mean.days = mean(Wage), sd.days = sd(Wage), var.days = var(Wage),\n        med.days = median(Wage), iqr.days = IQR(Wage))\n\n  mean.days  sd.days var.days med.days iqr.days\n1  40.14567 7.047058 49.66103    41.82   11.465\n\n\n\n\n6.1.8 Group_by\n\ngroup_by is used for grouping data by one or more variables. When you use group_by() on a data frame, it doesn’t actually perform any computations immediately. Instead, it sets up the data frame in such a way that any subsequent operations are performed within these groups\nsummarize() is often used in combination with group_by() to calculate summary statistics within groups\n\n\n## summarize data by Industry variable.\ngroupedData &lt;- gig %&gt;%\n    group_by(Industry) %&gt;%\n    summarize(meanWage = mean(Wage))\ngroupedData\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  Industry     meanWage\n  &lt;fct&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Automotive       43.4\n2 Construction     38.3\n3 Tech             40.7\n4 &lt;NA&gt;             39.5\n\n## same function with na's dropped.\ngroupedData &lt;- gig %&gt;%\n    drop_na() %&gt;%\n    group_by(Industry) %&gt;%\n    summarize(meanWage = mean(Wage))\ngroupedData\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  Industry     meanWage\n  &lt;fct&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Automotive       43.4\n2 Construction     38.4\n3 Tech             40.7\n\n\n\n\n6.1.9 Mutate\n\nmutate() is part of the dplyr package, which is used for data manipulation. The mutate() function is specifically designed to create new variables (columns) or modify existing variables in a data frame. It is commonly used in data wrangling tasks to add calculated columns or transform existing ones.\nOne example is below, but note that there are many things you can do with the mutate function.\n\n\n# making a new variable called calculation that multiplies gdp_pc by\n# infl variables in the africa1 dataset.\nafrica.mutated &lt;- mutate(africa1, calculation = gdp_pc * infl)\nhead(africa.mutated)\n\n  year      country gdp_pc  infl trade    civlib population calculation\n1 1972 Burkina Faso    377 -2.92 29.69 0.5000000    5848380    -1100.84\n2 1973 Burkina Faso    376  7.60 31.31 0.5000000    5958700     2857.60\n3 1974 Burkina Faso    393  8.72 35.22 0.3333333    6075700     3426.96\n4 1975 Burkina Faso    416 18.76 40.11 0.3333333    6202000     7804.16\n5 1976 Burkina Faso    435 -8.40 37.76 0.5000000    6341030    -3654.00\n6 1977 Burkina Faso    448 29.99 41.11 0.6666667    6486870    13435.52\n\n\n\nBelow is an example with the iris dataset, which is part of base R.\n\n\ndata(\"iris\")\n## Selecting 2 variables from the iris dataset: Sepal.Length and\n## Petal.Length\nselected_data &lt;- select(iris, Sepal.Length, Petal.Length)\nhead(selected_data)\n\n  Sepal.Length Petal.Length\n1          5.1          1.4\n2          4.9          1.4\n3          4.7          1.3\n4          4.6          1.5\n5          5.0          1.4\n6          5.4          1.7\n\n# Filter rows based on a condition: Species = setosa\nfiltered_data &lt;- filter(iris, Species == \"setosa\")\nhead(filtered_data)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n\n# Arrange rows by the Sepal.Length column\narranged_data &lt;- arrange(iris, Sepal.Length)\n# Create a new column by mutating the data by transforming\n# Petal.Width to the log form.\nmutated_data &lt;- mutate(iris, Petal.Width_Log = log(Petal.Width))",

    "text": "6.1 Full Examples\n\n6.1.1 gss.2016 Data Cleaning\n\nFirst, because we made some edits to the data set, reread in version a using the read.csv command. This brings the data set back to its original form. It is always a good idea to read the dataset back in when you are unsure about whether you have made a mistake during data preparation that could cause a lack of data integrity.\n\n\n\ngss.2016 &lt;- read.csv(file = \"data/gss2016.csv\")\n\n\nBefore we remove any missing data, we need it to be the correct data type. In this case, grass should be a factor.\n\n\n# We coerced this variable earlier, but the object was called\n# gss.2016.  Since we reread in the data set, this needs to be done\n# again.\ngss.2016$grass &lt;- as.factor(gss.2016$grass)\n\n\nThe statement below is an equivalent to the function above, but written with the piping operator. It is overwriting gss.2016 after conducting the coercion to factor.\nWe added the mutate function because we are going to add other data cleaning tasks to this statement.\n\n\ngss.2016 &lt;- gss.2016 %&gt;%\n    mutate(grass = as.factor(grass))\n\n\n6.1.1.1 Piping to More Functions: Missing Data\n\nIn the code below, the as.factor() command has been moved inside a broader mutate statement (that uses tidyverse library) and piped to it the na_if() command that handles missing data. If you use more than one data manipulation statement, the mutate() command is needed to help organize your code with one mutate() is needed for each major change you are making.\nIn the code below, we created a new object gss.2016.cleaned to help store the cleaned version of the dataset. This helps maintain data integrity because your original dataset is still intact and each time, you rerun the entire chunk, which includes all the changes at one time.\n\n\ngss.2016.cleaned &lt;- gss.2016 %&gt;%\n    # Moved coercion statement into a mutate function to keep code\n    # tidy\nmutate(grass = as.factor(grass)) %&gt;%\n    # Moving DK value to NA for not applicable\nmutate(grass = na_if(x = grass, y = \"DK\"))\n\n# Check the summary, there should be 110 + 3 = 113 in the NA category\nsummary(object = gss.2016.cleaned)\n\n       grass          age           \n DK       :   0   Length:2867       \n IAP      : 911   Class :character  \n LEGAL    :1126   Mode  :character  \n NOT LEGAL: 717                     \n NA's     : 113                     \n\n\n\n\n6.1.1.2 Drop Levels\n\nThe droplevels function is part of base R and is used to drop unused levels from factor variables in a data frame. It works by removing any levels from a factor variable that are not present in the data.\nNext, we want to edit our code to convert IAP and DK to NA values and drop levels that have are empty.\n\nNote the Piping operator added to the end of the DK line so you can keep going with new commands editing gss.2016.cleaned.\n\n\ngss.2016.cleaned &lt;- gss.2016 %&gt;%\n    mutate(grass = as.factor(grass)) %&gt;%\n    # Added piping operator\nmutate(grass = na_if(x = grass, y = \"DK\")) %&gt;%\n    # Turn to na if value of grass = IAP\nmutate(grass = na_if(x = grass, y = \"IAP\")) %&gt;%\n    # Drop levels in grass that have no values\nmutate(grass = droplevels(x = grass))\n# Check what you just did\nsummary(gss.2016.cleaned)\n\n       grass          age           \n LEGAL    :1126   Length:2867       \n NOT LEGAL: 717   Class :character  \n NA's     :1024   Mode  :character  \n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.1.3 Coercing to Numeric\n\nNext, we handle a numerical variable, age. Age again has an issue being able to be numerical data type because it has “89 OR OLDER” as a value. Before using the as.numeric() command, we need to recode it. We did this above as a stand-alone statement.\n\n\n\ngss.2016.cleaned &lt;- gss.2016 %&gt;%\n    mutate(grass = as.factor(grass)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(grass = na_if(x = grass, y = \"DK\")) %&gt;%\n    mutate(grass = na_if(x = grass, y = \"IAP\")) %&gt;%\n    # Added piping operator\nmutate(grass = droplevels(x = grass)) %&gt;%\n    # Ensure variable can be coded as numeric and fix if necessary.\nmutate(age = recode(age, `89 OR OLDER` = \"89\")) %&gt;%\n    # Coerce into numeric\nmutate(age = as.numeric(x = age))\n\n# Check what you just did\nsummary(gss.2016.cleaned)\n\n       grass           age       \n LEGAL    :1126   Min.   :18.00  \n NOT LEGAL: 717   1st Qu.:34.00  \n NA's     :1024   Median :49.00  \n                  Mean   :49.16  \n                  3rd Qu.:62.00  \n                  Max.   :89.00  \n                  NA's   :10     \n\n\n\nThe recode() command that is part of dplyr is like the ifelse() command that is in base R. There are a lot of ways to recode in R.\nFinally, we want to take our numerical variable, age, and cut it at certain breaks to make categories that can be easily analyzed.\n\nThis also ensures that anyone above 89 is coded correctly in a category instead of as the value 89. This again brings back data integrity.\nLast, we want to recode the age variable into categories. We can use the case_when to do this.\n\n\n\ngss.2016.cleaned &lt;- gss.2016 %&gt;%\n    mutate(grass = as.factor(grass)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(grass = na_if(x = grass, y = \"DK\")) %&gt;%\n    mutate(grass = na_if(x = grass, y = \"IAP\")) %&gt;%\n    mutate(grass = droplevels(x = grass)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(age = recode(age, `89 OR OLDER` = \"89\")) %&gt;%\n    # Added piping operator\nmutate(age = as.numeric(x = age)) %&gt;%\n    # Cut numeric variable into groupings\nmutate(age.cat = as.factor(case_when(age &lt; 30 ~ \"&lt; 30\", age &gt;= 30 & age &lt;=\n    59 ~ \"30 - 59\", age &gt;= 60 & age &lt;= 74 ~ \"60 - 74\", age &gt;= 75 ~ \"75+\",\n    TRUE ~ NA_character_  # Safety net for NAs\n)))\n# Check what you just did\nsummary(gss.2016.cleaned)\n\n       grass           age           age.cat    \n LEGAL    :1126   Min.   :18.00   &lt; 30   : 481  \n NOT LEGAL: 717   1st Qu.:34.00   30 - 59:1517  \n NA's     :1024   Median :49.00   60 - 74: 598  \n                  Mean   :49.16   75+    : 261  \n                  3rd Qu.:62.00   NA's   :  10  \n                  Max.   :89.00                 \n                  NA's   :10                    \n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 brfss Data Cleaning\n\nThe full codebook where this screenshot is taken is brfss_2014_codebook.pdf.\n\n\n\n\nEvaluate CodeBook Before Making Decisions\n\n\n\nbrfss &lt;- read.csv(\"data/brfss.csv\")\nsummary(brfss)\n\n    TRNSGNDR        X_AGEG5YR          X_RACE         X_INCOMG    \n Min.   :1.000    Min.   : 1.000   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :1.000  \n 1st Qu.:4.000    1st Qu.: 5.000   1st Qu.:1.000   1st Qu.:3.000  \n Median :4.000    Median : 8.000   Median :1.000   Median :5.000  \n Mean   :4.059    Mean   : 7.822   Mean   :1.992   Mean   :4.481  \n 3rd Qu.:4.000    3rd Qu.:10.000   3rd Qu.:1.000   3rd Qu.:5.000  \n Max.   :9.000    Max.   :14.000   Max.   :9.000   Max.   :9.000  \n NA's   :310602                    NA's   :94                     \n    X_EDUCAG        HLTHPLN1         HADMAM          X_AGE80     \n Min.   :1.000   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :1.000    Min.   :18.00  \n 1st Qu.:2.000   1st Qu.:1.000   1st Qu.:1.000    1st Qu.:44.00  \n Median :3.000   Median :1.000   Median :1.000    Median :58.00  \n Mean   :2.966   Mean   :1.108   Mean   :1.215    Mean   :55.49  \n 3rd Qu.:4.000   3rd Qu.:1.000   3rd Qu.:1.000    3rd Qu.:69.00  \n Max.   :9.000   Max.   :9.000   Max.   :9.000    Max.   :80.00  \n                                 NA's   :208322                  \n    PHYSHLTH   \n Min.   : 1.0  \n 1st Qu.:20.0  \n Median :88.0  \n Mean   :61.2  \n 3rd Qu.:88.0  \n Max.   :99.0  \n NA's   :4     \n\n\n\n6.1.2.1 Qualitative Variable\n\nTo look at an example, the one below seeks to understand the healthcare issue in reporting gender based on different definitions.

Removing the NA’s moved the “Not transgender” category to over 97% of observations.\n\n\n\n6.1.2.2 Quantitative Variable\n\nLet’s use the cleaned dataset to make more changes to the continuous variable PHYSHLTH. In the codebook, it looks like the data is most applicable to the first 2 categories. The 1-30 days coding and the 88 coding, which means 0 days of physical illness and injury.\n\nUsing cleaned data, we need to prep the variable a little more before getting an accurate plot.\nSpecifically, we need to null out the 77 and 99 values and make sure the 88 coding is set to be 0 for 0 days of illness and injury.\n\n\n\nbrfss.cleaned &lt;- brfss %&gt;%\n    mutate(TRNSGNDR = recode_factor(TRNSGNDR, `1` = \"Male to female\", `2` = \"Female to male\",\n        `3` = \"Gender non-conforming\", `4` = \"Not transgender\", `7` = \"Not sure\",\n        `9` = \"Refused\")) %&gt;%\n    # Turn the 77 values to NA's.\nmutate(PHYSHLTH = na_if(PHYSHLTH, y = 77)) %&gt;%\n    # Turn the 99 values to NA's.\nmutate(PHYSHLTH = na_if(PHYSHLTH, y = 99)) %&gt;%\n    # Recode the 88 values to be numeric value of 0.\nmutate(PHYSHLTH = recode(PHYSHLTH, `88` = 0L))\n\n\nThe histogram showed most people have between 0 and 10 unhealthy days per 30 days.\nNext, evaluate mean, median, and mode for the PHYSHLTH variable after ignoring the blanks.\n\n\nmean(brfss.cleaned$PHYSHLTH, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 4.224106\n\nmedian(brfss.cleaned$PHYSHLTH, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 0\n\nnames(x = sort(x = table(brfss.cleaned$PHYSHLTH), decreasing = TRUE))[1]\n\n[1] \"0\"\n\n\n\nWhile the mean is higher at 4.22, the median and most common number is 0.\n\n\n## Spread to Report with the Mean\nvar(brfss.cleaned$PHYSHLTH, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 77.00419\n\nsd(brfss.cleaned$PHYSHLTH, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 8.775203\n\n## Spread to Report with Median\nsummary(brfss.cleaned$PHYSHLTH, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

This indicates a clear right skew which means the data is not normally distributed.\nThe kurtosis results are also very leptokurtic with a score of 478.063.\n\n\n\n6.1.2.3 Using Filters Example\n\nBelow takes an example of the brfss data to filter by certain variable statuses.\n\nThe first filter() chose observations that were any one of the three categories of transgender included in the data. Used the | “or” operator for this filter().\nThe second filter chose people in an age category above category 4 but below category 12, in the age categories 5 through 11.\nThe last filter used the !is.na to choose observations where HADMAM variable was not NA.\n\nNext, we reduce data set to contain only variables used to create table by using the select() command.\nNext, we change all the remaining variables in data set to factors using mutate_all() command. This not only changes the strings to factors, but also changes the numerical variables to factors.\nFinally, we use mutate() commands to change the variable category to something meaningful(from the codebook).\n\nNotice the backslash before the apostrophe in Don’t in the X_INCOMG recode. This is to prevent the .R file from ending the quotations. You could use double quotes around the statement to bypass this, or add the backslash like I did here.\n\n\nbrfss_small &lt;- brfss.cleaned %&gt;%\n    filter(TRNSGNDR == \"Male to female\" | TRNSGNDR == \"Female to male\" |\n        TRNSGNDR == \"Gender non-conforming\") %&gt;%\n    filter(X_AGEG5YR &gt; 4 & X_AGEG5YR &lt; 12) %&gt;%\n    filter(!is.na(HADMAM)) %&gt;%\n    select(TRNSGNDR, X_AGEG5YR, X_RACE, X_INCOMG, X_EDUCAG, HLTHPLN1, HADMAM) %&gt;%\n    mutate_all(as.factor) %&gt;%\n    # The next few mutates add labels to categorical variables based\n    # on the codebook.\nmutate(X_AGEG5YR = recode_factor(X_AGEG5YR, `5` = \"40-44\", `6` = \"45-49\",\n    `7` = \"50-54\", `8` = \"55-59\", `9` = \"60-64\", `10` = \"65-69\", `11` = \"70-74\")) %&gt;%\n    mutate(X_INCOMG = recode_factor(X_INCOMG, `1` = \"Less than 15,000\",\n        `2` = \"15,000 to less than 25,000\", `3` = \"25,000 to less than 35,000\",\n        `4` = \"35,000 to less than 50,000\", `5` = \"50,000 or more\", `9` = \"Don't know/not sure/missing\")) %&gt;%\n    mutate(X_EDUCAG = recode_factor(X_EDUCAG, `1` = \"Did not graduate high school\",\n        `2` = \"Graduated high school\", `3` = \"Attended college/technical school\",\n        `4` = \"Graduated from college/technical school\", `9` = NA_character_)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(HLTHPLN1 = recode_factor(HLTHPLN1, `1` = \"Yes\", `2` = \"No\",\n        `7` = \"Don't know/not sure/missing\", `9` = \"Refused\")) %&gt;%\n    mutate(X_RACE = recode_factor(X_RACE, `1` = \"White\", `2` = \"Black\",\n        `3` = \"Native American\", `4` = \"Asian/Pacific Islander\", `5` = \"Other\",\n        `6` = \"Other\", `7` = \"Other\", `8` = \"Other\", `9` = \"Other\"))\n# print a summary\nsummary(brfss_small)\n\n                  TRNSGNDR   X_AGEG5YR                     X_RACE   \n Male to female       : 77   40-44:27   White                 :152  \n Female to male       :113   45-49:27   Black                 : 31  \n Gender non-conforming: 32   50-54:32   Native American       :  4  \n Not transgender      :  0   55-59:44   Asian/Pacific Islander:  6  \n Not sure             :  0   60-64:44   Other                 : 29  \n Refused              :  0   65-69:24                               \n                             70-74:24                               \n                        X_INCOMG                                     X_EDUCAG \n Less than 15,000           :46   Did not graduate high school           :24  \n 15,000 to less than 25,000 :44   Graduated high school                  :86  \n 25,000 to less than 35,000 :19   Attended college/technical school      :68  \n 35,000 to less than 50,000 :26   Graduated from college/technical school:44  \n 50,000 or more             :65                                               \n Don't know/not sure/missing:22                                               \n\n HLTHPLN1  HADMAM \n Yes:198   1:198  \n No : 24   2: 22  \n           9:  2  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis data set full of categorical variables is now fully cleaned and ready to be analyzed!",

    "text": "5.2 Graphs for a Single Categorical Variable\n\nA categorical variable has categories that are either ordinal with a logical order or nominal with no logical order.\nCategorical variables need to be set as the factor data type in R to be able to be analyzed and visualized correctly.\nSome common graphing options for single categorical variable:\n\nBar graph\nPie chart\n\nIn any graph, it is beneficial to do any data cleaning and investigation into the variable(s) before you begin. With categorical variables, this may require recoding the factor(s) of interest and possibly renaming it/them to something meaningful if needed.\n\n\n5.2.1 Bar Graph\n\nA bar graph depicts the frequency or the relative frequency for each category of the qualitative data as a bar rising vertically from the horizontal axis. A bar graph is also known as a bar chart and is often used to examine similarities and differences across categories of things; bars can represent frequencies, percentages, means, or other statistics.\nWe can learn a lot from a bar graph, like the marital status group with the highest and lowest frequencies according to the census.gov.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.1.1 geom_bar()\n\nCreate a Bar Graph using ggplot() Command\nLike histograms, ggplot has many more parameters available over base R to construct bar graphs.\nFirst, we load tidyerse to access ggplot() command and others. You can always do this at the start of all your code to keep all the libraries together that are being used.\n\n\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\n\n\nggplot() works in layers, so you will routinely see the + symbol to kick off a new layer with added functionality.\nUsing the ggplot, we always include the aes() command first inside the ggplot() command. The aes() command is a quoting function that describes the variables being used. From there, it depends on the plot.\n\nFirst layer: ggplot() and aes() which calls the dataset and variables used.\nSecond layer: Graph type: Bar graph: geom_bar().\nAdditional layers: labs - for labels including titles; themes; and geom_text. Recreate the example below adding one layer at a time to see how the visualization changes.\n\n\n\n\n5.2.1.2 Pertinent Parameters to the geom_bar()\n\nstat=“identity”: In ggplot2, the argument stat=“identity” is used inside the geom_bar when creating bar charts to specify that the actual values of the data should be plotted, rather than calculated summary statistics. By default, ggplot assumes that bar charts use stat=“count”, which counts the number of observations in each category. When you want to display the actual values in your dataset (e.g., sales numbers, average scores), you need to set stat=“identity” to ensure that the y-values are mapped directly from the data rather than being automatically counted.\nposition=“dodge”: If we have more than one categorical variable, we might set the position=“dodge” argument. This argument controls how the bars are positioned relative to each other when you are plotting multiple categories within a bar chart. By default, bars in a bar chart are stacked, and setting position=“dodge” ensures that they are placed side-by-side. This is particularly useful when you are comparing multiple groups or categories within the same plot, as it allows for a clear visual distinction between each group. In the example below, we only have one variable, so position=“dodge” argument is not needed.\n\nIn combination, using stat=“identity” and position=“dodge” is common when you want to compare different categories or groups with specific values in a side-by-side manner, ensuring the chart is easy to interpret. For example, if you are comparing sales figures across different products for multiple years, this approach would give you a bar for each product in each year, clearly separated.\nshow.legend = FALSE: In ggplot2, the argument show.legend = FALSE is used to hide the legend for a particular layer or the entire plot. By default, ggplot2 automatically adds a legend if you include aesthetics like color, size, or shape that distinguish groups in your data. If you don’t want the legend to appear, you can set show.legend = FALSE.\nscale_fill_manual(): When creating grouped bar charts or other plots with multiple categories, it’s important to ensure that the visual distinction between groups is clear. This is where manually setting the colors for each category comes into play. The scale_fill_manual() function in ggplot2 allows you to manually define the colors used for the filled areas, such as the bars in a bar chart or the shaded areas in an area chart. By using the values argument within scale_fill_manual(), you can specify a custom color palette that suits your design or presentation needs. For example, you might choose a palette of yellow and brown to represent different categories. A key aspect of using scale_fill_manual() effectively is knowing how many colors to provide. The number of colors you define in the values argument must match the number of levels or categories in your data. If you are comparing three product categories, for instance, you’ll need to provide exactly three colors—one for each category. Failing to match the number of colors to the number of categories can result in errors or misrepresentation in the plot. For example, if you have four levels (e.g., four different product categories or groups) and only provide two colors, ggplot may not know how to properly assign colors to the additional categories. Therefore, it’s crucial to know the number of distinct categories in your data and plan your color palette accordingly to maintain clarity and visual consistency in your chart.\n\n\n## inputting probabilities calculated from a 2023 multiple choice\n## question.

In doing so, lets use a dataset to make a bar graph instead of relying on pre-calculated data.\n\nLets examine the AUQ300 variable from the nhanes survey to run an example.\n\n\nnhanes &lt;- read.csv(\"data/nhanes2012.csv\")\n\n\nNext, we need to check the import by looking at the summary or head of the data.\n\n\n# Results hidden to save space, but gives you the first 6 records in\n# the data set.\nhead(nhanes)\n\n\nWe can also check the summary of data of only the variable of interest, AUQ300, to get a sense of what we are evaluating.\n\n\nsummary(nhanes$AUQ300)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n  1.000   1.000   2.000   1.656   2.000   7.000    4689 \n\n\n\nThe AUQ300 variable represents gun use. A screenshot of the codebook is copied below so that we can see what AUQ300 really refers to. It is available on https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2011-2012/AUQ_G.htm. This is always a necessary step because variable names can be convoluted and not representative of the variable definition.\n\n\n\n\nAUQ300\n\n\n\n5.2.2.1 Recode Variable if Needed\n\nLook to see if the AUQ300 needs recoding after looking at the codebook and making sense of the variable.\nAUQ300 needs to be a factor variable with 1 equaling a Yes and 2 equaling a No. We can use recode_factor to accomplish 2 things at once with the mutate function.\nrecode_factor() transforms the levels of a categorical variable (factor) into a new set of levels and is specific to categorical variables.\nrecode() is generic and can apply to numerical, categorical, or textual data, but still transforms data from one format or code to another.\n\n\nnhanes.clean &lt;- nhanes %&gt;%\n    select(AUQ300) %&gt;%\n    mutate(AUQ300 = recode_factor(AUQ300, `1` = \"Yes\", `2` = \"No\"))\n\n\nThen, we need to check the recode for accuracy. You should see the No’s and Yes’s alongside the rest being coded as NA’s.\n\n\nsummary(nhanes.clean)\n\n  AUQ300    \n Yes :1613  \n No  :3061  \n NA's:4690  \n\n\n\n\n5.2.2.2 Get Bar Roughly Plotted\n\nStart with the basic plot using the ggplot() and geom_bar() commands.\nBelow writes the statement with and without the piping operator.\n\nSince we are also going to use data preparation techniques, the piping operator is recommended.\n\n\n# Without piping operator\nggplot(nhanes.clean, aes(x = AUQ300)) + geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# With piping operator\nnhanes.clean %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = AUQ300)) + geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2.3 Add Functions to Clean Chart\n\nOmit the NA category from AUQ300 variable, which represents gun use. Then plot the graph below.\nThe drop_na() function is a good way to drop NA values from either the entire dataset or just one variable. It was introduced in the data prep lesson. Since we are only interested in dropping NA values from our one variable of interest that is to be graphed (AUQ300), we can put it in the parentheses so that we do not unintentionally drop lots of observations for no reason.\nAdd an axis labels under labs(x = …, y=…).\n\n\nnhanes.clean %&gt;%\n  drop_na(AUQ300) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = AUQ300)) + geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Gun use\", y = \"Number of participants\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##Here, we really benefit from the piping operator because we are doing more than one thing.\n\n\nFrom the bar graph, we can see that almost double the amount of people have not fired a firearm for any reason than those that fired one.\n\n\n\n5.2.2.4 Adding Color\n\nThere are many ways to add color to a bar graph. Below, the color is filled in directly in the aes() command by choosing it to give a different color to each categorical value of AUQ300.\n\nWhen fill is mapped to a variable, the fill color of the geom will vary based on the values of that variable. This is useful for distinguishing different groups or categories within the data. In this case the fill=AUQ300 gives a distinct color pattern based on how many categories there are considering the fact we are using the default “scale.”\n\n\nnhanes.clean %&gt;%\n  drop_na(AUQ300) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(AUQ300, fill=AUQ300)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Gun use\", y = \"Number of participants\", \n       subtitle = \"Filled inside the aes()\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2.5 Data Prep and Then Visualized\n\nIn the command below, we create a gss.2016.cleaned object to make a barplot. In doing so, we do the following:\nCreate a bar graph using the ggplot() command, which requires an aes() quoting function. This function says that we want to use the grass variable in our bar graph.\nDrop all NAs from the grass variable so that legal and not legal are the only categories.\nWe then create the bars and fill them with 2 colors, red and purple. Many color codes can be used here, and will be discussed in a later lesson.\nWe then add labels to our graph on both x and y axis.\nFinally, we print the new graph, which is saved under the legalize.bar object.\nBelow, I brought back over the code from the last part in Data Preparation. You should still have this in your Chapter1.R file. We are going to use that file to create a graphics in R.\n\n\ngss.2016 &lt;- read_csv(file = \"data/gss2016.csv\")\ngss.2016.cleaned &lt;- gss.2016 %&gt;%\n    mutate(grass = as.factor(grass)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(grass = na_if(x = grass, y = \"DK\")) %&gt;%\n    mutate(grass = na_if(x = grass, y = \"IAP\")) %&gt;%\n    mutate(grass = droplevels(x = grass)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(age = recode(age, `89 OR OLDER` = \"89\")) %&gt;%\n    mutate(age = as.numeric(x = age)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(age.cat = cut(x = age, breaks = c(-Inf, 29, 59, 74, Inf), labels = c(\"&lt; 30\",\n        \"30 - 59\", \"60 - 74\", \"75+\")))\n\n\nOnce the data is prepped, we can graph the variable or variables.\n\n\nggplot(gss.2016.cleaned, aes(grass)) + geom_bar()  ##with no piping operator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngss.2016.cleaned %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(grass)) + geom_bar()  ##with piping operator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Make a Bar Graph for Grass Variable\ngss.2016.cleaned %&gt;%\n    drop_na() %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(grass)) + geom_bar(fill = c(\"red\", \"blue\")) + labs(x = \"Should marijuana be legal\",\n    y = \"Frequency of Responses\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2.6 Edit The Graphic\n\nNext, we can edit these commands to include the age variable. The aes() quoting function has expanded to have the bars filled color using the grass variable, the age category has replaced the grass variable on the x axis.\n\n\ngss.2016.cleaned %&gt;%\n    drop_na() %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(age.cat, fill = grass)) + geom_bar() + labs(x = \"Age Category\",\n    y = \"Frequency of responses\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can add the position set at “dodge” inside the geom_bar() layer to make the barchart unstacked (or grouped).\n\n\ngss.2016.cleaned %&gt;%\n    drop_na() %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(age.cat, fill = grass)) + geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") +\n    labs(x = \"Age Category\", y = \"Frequency of responses\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can edit further to include a new a formula on the y axis to sum and count.\nIn the formula you provided, after_stat(count) is used within the ggplot2 framework to refer to the computed statistic generated by the geom_bar() function. Specifically, in the context of bar plots, count refers to the number of observations (or frequency) for each category within the data.\nWhen you use after_stat(count), you are referencing the count that is computed after geom_bar() has processed the data and calculated how many observations fall into each group (in this case, within each age category and the “grass” variable, which likely refers to attitudes toward marijuana legalization).\nWe also gave this a theme and updated the labels.\n\n\ngss.2016.cleaned %&gt;%\n    drop_na() %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(age.cat, y = 100 * (after_stat(count))/sum(after_stat(count)),\n        fill = grass)) + geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") + theme_minimal() +\n    labs(x = \"Age Category\", y = \"Percent of responses\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluate these graphs and see what information you can get from them.\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Pie Chart\n\nA pie chart is a segmented circle whose segments portray the relative frequencies of the categories of a qualitative variable.\nSlices of pie in different colors represent the parts.\nIn this example, the firearm is divided by type to show parts of a whole, where the total of the proportions must add to 1.0 and the total of the percentages must add to 100%.\n\n\n# Importing data from working directory\nfbi.deaths &lt;- read.csv(\"data/fbi_deaths.csv\", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)\n# Selecting rows of interest for pie chart\nfbi.deaths.small &lt;- fbi.deaths[c(3, 4, 5, 6, 7), ]\nfbi.deaths.small &lt;- fbi.deaths.small %&gt;%\n    rename(Weapon = X)\n# Checking summary of fbi deaths\nsummary(fbi.deaths.small)\n\n                       Weapon      X2012          X2013          X2014     \n Firearms, type not stated:1   Min.   : 116   Min.   : 123   Min.   :  93  \n Handguns                 :1   1st Qu.: 298   1st Qu.: 285   1st Qu.: 258  \n Other guns               :1   Median : 310   Median : 308   Median : 264  \n Rifles                   :1   Mean   :1779   Mean   :1691   Mean   :1662  \n Shotguns                 :1   3rd Qu.:1769   3rd Qu.:1956   3rd Qu.:2024  \n Asphyxiation             :0   Max.   :6404   Max.   :5782   Max.   :5673  \n (Other)                  :0                                               \n     X2015          X2016     \n Min.   : 177   Min.   : 186  \n 1st Qu.: 258   1st Qu.: 262  \n Median : 272   Median : 374  \n Mean   :1956   Mean   :2201  \n 3rd Qu.:2502   3rd Qu.:3077  \n Max.   :6569   Max.   :7105  \n                              \n\n\n\nAgain, ggplot works in layers, so in order to make a pie, you need a few layers and have a few optional ones.\n\nThe aes() command specifies the variable to create the pie, in this case x2016.\ngeom_col() sets the borders of the pie and makes it visible.\ncoord_polar() command makes the pie circular.\ntheme_void() command is optional and adjusts the theme of the pie. to remove axis, background, etc.\n\n\n\nggplot(fbi.deaths.small, aes(x=\"\", y=X2016, fill=Weapon)) +\n  geom_col() + \n  coord_polar(\"y\", start=0) + \n  theme_void() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the pie, we can see that the majority of weapons that caused fbi gun related deaths are handguns followed by a type of firearm that is not stated.\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Comparison of Charts\n\nRecommended graphs for single categorical or factor type variable:\n\nBar graph, for showing relative group sizes.\nPie charts are available in R but are not recommended because they tend to be less clear for comparing group sizes.\n\nPie charts are difficult to read since the relative size of pie pieces is often hard to determine.\nPie charts take up a lot of space to convey little information.\nPeople often use fancy formatting like 3D, which takes up more space and makes understanding relative size of pie pieces even more difficult.",

    "text": "5.3 Graphs for a Single Continuous Variable\n\nA continuous variable refers to a variable that can take any value over a range of values.\nA continuous variable needs to be numeric, and could be integer type or numeric type in R. Just like with graphs that include categorical variables, it is beneficial to do any data cleaning and investigation into the variable(s) before you begin. With continuous variables, this may require recoding the variable to coerce it to the appropriate data type and/or renaming it to something meaningful if needed.\nIt is also beneficial to make sure the numerical variable is indeed supposed to be numerical (as opposed to a factor). For instance, you commonly see numbers listed for categories like the Yes/No coded as a 1/2, such as with the AUQ300 variable.\n\nSome common graphing options for single continuous variable:\n\nHistograms (From Lesson 2)\nDensity plots\nBoxplots\nViolin plots\n\n\n5.3.1 Histograms\n\nA histogram is a useful plot to determine central tendency and spread.\nWe went over histograms in Lesson 2, so refer back for information on how to create a histogram using base R and ggplot.\nRemember that you can tell the distribution from a histogram, and that distribution can be normal or skewed (Right or Left).\n\nWith each chart based on quantitative data, you should be able to get a sense of the distribution.\nThe histogram below looks right skewed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Density Plots\n\nA density plot is similar to a histogram but more fluid in appearance because it does not have the separate bins.\n\nProbability density is not very useful for interpreting what is happening at any given value of the variable on the x-axis, but it is useful in computing the percentage of values that are within a range along the x-axis.\nThe area under the curve in a density plot could be interpreted as the probability of a single observation or a range of observations.\nWe can use random normal data to create the density plot like shown below with a sample of 1000, a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 2. To do this, we need to make the vector and assign it to a data frame.\nIn R, set.seed() is a function used to set the seed for random number generation. By setting a seed using set.seed(), you ensure reproducibility of your code. If you run the same code with the same seed, you’ll get the same sequence of random numbers every time. This is particularly useful for debugging, testing, or when you want to ensure that your results are reproducible.\nWe use set.seed before any function with a random normal generator to ensure reproducibility.\nIf a dataset is provided, then you do not need to generate your own random data as shown in the step below.\n\n\n\nset.seed(1)\nx &lt;- rnorm(1000, mean = 10, sd = 2)\ndf &lt;- data.frame(x)\n\n\nNext, we can make the density plot using the ggplot2 package under tidyverse.\n\nLayer 2 includes the geom_density() command in addition to the standard Layer 1 ggplot() command to create the density plot.\n\n\n\nggplot(df, aes(x)) + geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of arguments you can change. I selected a couple below. Be sure to look at the help file on the geom_density() layer to get the variety on what you can do.\n\ncolor = sets a line color\nlwd = makes the line thicker. Increase this number for thicker line.\nfill= colors the area under the curve.\nalpha= sets the transparency to the area under the curve.\n\n\n\nggplot(df, aes(x)) + geom_density(color = \"darkblue\", lwd = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(df, aes(x)) + geom_density(color = \"darkblue\", fill = \"lightblue\",\n    alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can even add a mean line, which we know in this case is 10 because we used random normal data with that mean set as a parameter.\ngeom_vline() is a function used to add vertical lines to a plot created with ggplot. This function is useful for visually indicating specific points or ranges on the x-axis.\nYou can do a line break in your R code after a comma (\\(,\\)) or after a plus sign (\\(+\\)). I find things easier to read on less lines, but it is personal preference how many lines you use given still following the rules in R.\n\n\n\nggplot(df, aes(x)) + geom_density(color = \"darkblue\", fill = \"lightblue\",\n    alpha = 0.5) + geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(x)), color = \"red\",\n    linetype = \"dashed\", lwd = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou do not need the rnorm function if you are provided a dataset with a numerical variable. The following code uses the customers dataset to do 2 examples of density plots with 2 numerical variables.\n\n\ncustomers &lt;- read.csv(\"data/customers.csv\")\n\nstr(customers)\n\n'data.frame':   200 obs. of  10 variables:\n $ CustID   : int  1530016 1531136 1532160 1532307 1532356 1532387 1533017 1533561 1533697 1533766 ...\n $ Sex      : chr  \"Female\" \"Male\" \"Male\" \"Male\" ...\n $ Race     : chr  \"Black\" \"White\" \"Black\" \"White\" ...\n $ BirthDate: chr  \"12/16/1986\" \"5/9/1993\" \"5/22/1966\" \"9/16/1964\" ...\n $ College  : chr  \"Yes\" \"Yes\" \"Yes\" \"Yes\" ...\n $ HHSize   : int  5 5 2 4 5 2 3 5 3 2 ...\n $ Income   : int  53000 94000 64000 60000 47000 67000 84000 76000 42000 71000 ...\n $ Spending : int  241 843 719 582 845 452 153 1079 247 708 ...\n $ Orders   : int  3 12 9 13 7 9 2 23 3 4 ...\n $ Channel  : chr  \"SM\" \"TV\" \"TV\" \"SM\" ...\n\nggplot(customers, aes(Income)) + geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(customers, aes(Orders)) + geom_density(color = \"#745033\", fill = \"#740000\",\n    alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Boxplot\n\nA boxplot is a visual representation of data that shows central tendency (usually the median) and spread (usually the interquartile range) of a numeric variable for one or more groups.\nBoxplots are often used to compare the distribution of a continuous variable across several groups.\nA box plot allows you to:\n\nGraphically display the distribution of a data set.\nCompare two or more distributions.\nIdentify outliers in a data set.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Boxplot with Outliers on Left\n\n\n\nBoxplots include the following information:\n\nA line representing the median value.\nA box containing the middle 50% of values.\nWhiskers extending to 1.5 times the IQR.\nOutliers more than 1.5 times the IQR away from the median.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Boxplot with No Outliers\n\n\n\nThis boxplot above displays 5 summary values:\n\nS = smallest value.\nL = largest value.\nQ1 = first quantile = 25th percentile.\nQ2 = median = second quantile = 50th percentile.\nQ3 = third quantile = 75th percentile.\n\nFor example, use the GrowthFund Vector from the last lesson. It is executed again below.\n\n\nGrowthFund &lt;- c(-38.32, 1.71, 3.17, 5.99, 12.56, 13.47, 16.89, 16.96, 32.16,\n    36.29)\nGrowthFund &lt;- as.data.frame(GrowthFund)\n\n\nThe quantile() function returns the five point summary when no arguments are specified where the 25th percentile is Quarter 1, and the 75 percentile is Quarter 3.

In the plot below, I graphed mpg as a violin plot. You can also embed other visual markers like mean and median or layer on another graph like a boxplot.\nYou can see that this violin plot is vertical. The coord_flip() command we used above flips the chart horizontal the same way it flips a boxplot.\n\n\nmtcars %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x=\"\", y = mpg)) +\n  geom_violin(fill=\"lightgreen\") +\n  theme_minimal() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could also merge both a violin and a boxplot. The code below shows two separate charts (and also flipped) using the following code and then merges them into one visualization.\nThe width parameter controls the width of the boxes in a boxplot or the width of the violins in a violin plot. You can vary this parameter to create better depth.\n\n\ndata(mtcars)\n\nmtcars %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = \"\", y = mpg)) + geom_boxplot(color = \"#986D00\", fill = \"#24585E\") +\n    theme_minimal() + coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s get some summary statistics to check for outliers, skewness, and kurtosis to see how our visual aids help us in understanding those results.\n\n\nIQRvalue &lt;- IQR(mtcars$mpg)\nOutlierValue &lt;- IQRvalue * 1.5\nOutlierValue  #11.0625\n\n[1] 11.0625\n\nQuanData &lt;- quantile(mtcars$mpg)\nQuanData\n\n    0%    25%    50%    75%   100% \n10.400 15.425 19.200 22.800 33.900 \n\nQuanData[2] - QuanData[1] &gt; OutlierValue\n\n  25% \nFALSE \n\n# Using the numbers from QuadData\n15.425 - 10.4 &gt; 11.0625\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n# False indicating no outlier to the left\n\n\nQuanData[5] - QuanData[4] &gt; OutlierValue\n\n100% \nTRUE \n\n33.9 - 22.8 &gt; 11.0625\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# TRUE indicating an outlier to the right.\n\n\nWe can see more specific information on outliers if we calculate the lower bound and upper bound and insert the values into the vector.\n\n\nQ1 &lt;- QuanData[2]\nQ1\n\n   25% \n15.425 \n\nLowerBound &lt;- Q1 - OutlierValue\nLowerBound  #4.3625 \n\n   25% \n4.3625 \n\nQ3 &lt;- QuanData[4]\nQ3\n\n 75% \n22.8 \n\nUpperBound &lt;- Q3 + OutlierValue\nUpperBound  #33.8625 \n\n    75% \n33.8625 \n\nsort(mtcars$mpg)\n\n [1] 10.4 10.4 13.3 14.3 14.7 15.0 15.2 15.2 15.5 15.8 16.4 17.3 17.8 18.1 18.7\n[16] 19.2 19.2 19.7 21.0 21.0 21.4 21.4 21.5 22.8 22.8 24.4 26.0 27.3 30.4 30.4\n[31] 32.4 33.9\n\n\n[LowerBound: 4.3625] 10.4 10.4 13.3 14.3 14.7 15.0 15.2 15.2 15.5 15.8 16.4 17.3 17.8 18.1 18.7 19.2 19.2 19.7 21.0 21.0 21.4 21.4 21.5 22.8 22.8 24.4 26.0 27.3 30.4 30.4 32.4 [UpperBound: 33.8625)] 33.9\n\nsemTools::skew(mtcars$mpg)  #normal\n\nskew (g1)        se         z         p \n    0.672     0.433     1.553     0.120 \n\nsemTools::kurtosis(mtcars$mpg)  #mesokurtic\n\nExcess Kur (g2)              se               z               p \n         -0.022           0.866          -0.025           0.980 \n\n\n\nLooks like the mpg variable is quite normal with one potential outlier to the right, but no major signs of skewness or kurtosis.\nWe can also get a histogram of mpg and are able to make the same claims towards normality.

    "text": "5.4 Graphs for Two Variables At Once\n\nCombinations of 2 Variable Types for Graphing\n\nTwo categorical/ factor.\nOne categorical/ factor and one continuous/ numeric.\nTwo continuous/ numeric.\n\n\n\n5.4.1 Bar Graphs for Two Categorical Variables\n\nThere are two formats available for bar charts:\n\nGrouped\nStacked\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   vs, gear [6]\n     vs  gear     n\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1     0     3    12\n2     0     4     2\n3     0     5     4\n4     1     3     3\n5     1     4    10\n6     1     5     1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.1.1 Grouped Bar Graph\n\nGrouped bar graph allow comparison of multiple sets of data items, with a single color used to denote a specific series across all sets.\nFor example, we can look at both the vs and gear variables in the ggplot command.\n\nYou can do a little grouping and counting before you began to generate a new table with frequencies based on vs and gear variables. Once a new dataset object is made, you can make the graph with the geom_bar layer specifying the stat=“identity”.\nSince there are two variables, you can set the position to dodge to view the fill categorical variable side by side.\n(stat = “identity”) tells ggplot that the y values are already computed and should be used as-is for the heights of the bars. In this case, they are frequencies calculated in the countsDF dataset.\n\n\n\nmtcars &lt;- mtcars %&gt;%\n    mutate(vs = as.factor(vs)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(gear = as.factor(gear))\n\n\ncountsDF &lt;- mtcars %&gt;%\n    group_by(vs, gear) %&gt;%\n    count()\n\nsummary(countsDF)\n\n vs    gear        n         \n 0:3   3:2   Min.   : 1.000  \n 1:3   4:2   1st Qu.: 2.250  \n       5:2   Median : 3.500  \n             Mean   : 5.333  \n             3rd Qu.: 8.500  \n             Max.   :12.000  \n\nggplot(countsDF, aes(x = gear, y = n, fill = vs)) + geom_bar(stat = \"identity\",\n    position = \"dodge\") + labs(title = \"Grouped Car Distribution by Gears and VS\",\n    x = \"Number of Gears\", y = \"Count\") + theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.1.2 Stacked Bar Graph\n\nA Stacked bar graph extends the standard bar graph from looking at numeric values across one categorical variable to two. Each bar in a standard bar graph is divided into a number of sub-bars stacked end to end, each one corresponding to a level of the second categorical variable.\nUsing ggplot, we can also stack these charts by removing the position = dodge statement.\n\n\nggplot(countsDF, aes(x = gear, y = n, fill = vs)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Stacked Car Distribution\",\n       x = \"Number of Gears\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.1.3 Bar Graph for Continuous Across Groups\n\nIn comparison to a bar graph for a single categorical variable, a bar chart for a continuous variable across groups includes both a x and y axis. The continuous variable is put on the y axis, and the categorical (factor) variable is placed on the x axis showing the groups.\nTherefore, instead of counting data based on group, we can see another continuous variable based on group data.\nThe frequency data (i.e., counts) can be replaced with another numerical variable like mean.\nIn the below example, instead of counting observations per group, here, we took the average mpg (a continuous variable) based on groups of gear and vs and summarized the data into a variable avg_mpg. We then used that variable in a ggplot() command to create a unique chart to that above.\n\n\navg_mpg &lt;- mtcars %&gt;%\n    group_by(gear, vs) %&gt;%\n    summarise(mpg = mean(mpg, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\nggplot(avg_mpg, aes(gear,\n  mpg, fill = vs)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Average MPG by VS and Gear\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, we can add color using the scale_fill_manual. Since there are two colors, we use the c() command to combine them together inside the layer.\n\n\nggplot(avg_mpg, aes(gear, mpg, fill = vs)) + geom_bar(stat = \"identity\",\n    position = \"dodge\", color = \"black\") + ggtitle(\"Average MPG by VS and Gear\") +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"yellow\", \"brown\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Boxplot for Continuous Across Groups\n\nA boxplot requires one continuous variable (like we did above). When we include an additional grouping variable, we get multiple boxplots, one for each group. This allows us to directly compare distributions.\nThe categorical variable should correctly be a factor data type before you begin.\nIn the example below, mpg is the continuous variable, and gear is the categorical variable.\nWe see 3 boxplots for three values of gear (3, 4, 5). ggplot() and geom_boxplot() are required components of the command. The scale_fill_manual() and theme_minimal() layers are optional ways to change the style and color.\n\n\nmtcars %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = gear, y = mpg, fill = gear)) +\n  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"gray\", \"red\", \"blue\")) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLets alter the functions above to depict mpg based on vs with categorical states 0 and 1.\n\n\nmtcars %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = vs, y = mpg, fill = vs)) + geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"gray\", \"red\")) + theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.3 Scatterplot for Two Continuous Variables\n\n5.4.3.1 Scatterplots\n\nA scatterplot is used to determine if two continuous variables are related.\n\nEach point is a pairing: \\((x_1, y_1),(x_2, y_2),\\) etc.\n\nOur goal with a scatterplot is to characterize the relationship by visual inspection. This includes determining if the relationship looks positive, negative, or not existent.\n\n\n\n\nScatterPlot Results\n\n\n\nSometimes, it is really clear how to characterize the relationship. Other times, additional statistical tests are needed to confirm the relationship (which we will go over in later lessons). This is true especially with big data, where the plot window can look like a giant blog of observations.\nLet’s work a clean example examining the relationship between income and the years of education one has had.\nThis plot has a clear positive trend, meaning that as one has more years of education, we see higher income. And similarly, as we see higher income, we also see more years of education. This means that a scatter can help characterize the relationship, and does not state that one variable is causing another to occur.\n\n\nEdu &lt;- read.csv(\"data/education.csv\")\nplot(Edu$Income ~ Edu$Education, ylab = \"Income\", xlab = \"Education\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with ggplot instead of base R, we would use the following code.\n\nLayer 1: ggplot() command with aes() command directly inside of it pointing to x and y variables.\nLayer 2: geom_point() command to add the observations as indicators in the chart.\nLayer 3 or more: many other optional additions like labs (for labels) as shown below.\n\n\nggplot(Edu, aes(x = Education, y = Income)) + geom_point() + labs(y = \"Income\",\n    x = \"Education\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_point() has some parameters you can change like shape = where you can add depth to your chart. Some common shapes of geom_point are as follows.\n\n\n# shape = 0, square shape = 1, circle shape = 2, triangle point up\n# shape = 3, plus shape = 4, cross shape = 5, diamond shape = 6,\n# triangle point down shape = 7, square cross shape = 8, star shape =\n# 9, diamond plus shape = 10, circle plus shape = 11, triangles up\n# and down shape = 12, square plus shape = 13, circle cross shape =\n# 14, square and triangle down shape = 15, filled square shape = 16,\n# filled circle shape = 17, filled triangle point-up shape = 18,\n# filled diamond\n\n\nFor instance, the code below changes the color, shape, and size of the geom_point().\n\n\nggplot(Edu, aes(x = Education, y = Income)) + geom_point(color = \"#183028\",\n    shape = 18, size = 10) + labs(y = \"Income\", x = \"Education\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_line() in R’s ggplot2 package is used to create line plots, which connect data points with straight lines. It is commonly used to visualize trends over time or continuous relationships between variables.\nggplot allows us to add a geom_line, which is helpful in drawing a line through the data. Here, I am also resetting the color off of the default value. You see this a lot on time series models like stock charts.\n\n\nggplot(Edu, aes(x = Education, y = Income)) + geom_point(color = \"#183028\",\n    shape = 18, size = 4) + labs(y = \"Income\", x = \"Education\") + geom_line(color = \"#789F90\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn R’s ggplot2 package, geom_smooth() is used to add a trendline (also called a smoothing line or a regression line) to a plot. It fits a line or curve through your data points based on a smoothing method, allowing you to visualize the general relationship between the x and y variables. The trendline can help reveal patterns such as linear relationships or trends in noisy data. The trendline give us 2 parts:\n\nTrendline: This line represents the fitted relationship between the two variables, which could be linear, polynomial, or a more flexible curve depending on the smoothing method used.\nConfidence Interval: The shaded area (often gray by default) around the trendline shows the confidence interval, giving a sense of the uncertainty of the fit.\n\nWe can change our line to a geom_smooth line, which is considered a trendline to help us visualize the relationship between the variables.\n\n\nggplot(Edu, aes(x = Education, y = Income)) + geom_point(color = \"#183028\",\n    shape = 18, size = 4) + labs(y = \"Income\", x = \"Education\") + geom_smooth(color = \"#789F90\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can change the type of trendline. The most common is the to develop the trendline using the lm method, which stands for the linear method that we are going to learn in the Regression lesson. For now, lets insert _method=“lm” into our geom_smooth() later to see the change.\nThe gray band on a scatter plot in R usually represents the confidence interval around a fitted line when you plot it using geom_smooth() in ggplot2. This gray area visualizes the uncertainty or variability of the estimated regression line, providing a sense of how confident we are about the predictions at different points along the line.\n\n\nggplot(Edu, aes(x = Education, y = Income)) + geom_point() + labs(y = \"Income\",\n    x = \"Education\") + geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"#789F90\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike geom_smooth(), which fits a trendline or smoothing line to data, geom_line() directly connects the raw data points in the order they appear (typically by the x-axis values). In business statistics class that teaches linear regression, we use more trendlines than geom_lines.\nLet’s look at a few more examples and see if the relationship is considered positive, negative, or not existent.\nBelow, we see a negative trend.\n\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = \"lm\",\n    color = \"#789F90\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn regards to the hp variable, below, we see another negative trend.\n\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = \"lm\",\n    color = \"#789F90\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn regards to the qsec variable, below, we see a weak positive trend. This relationship would need to verified later on.\n\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = qsec, y = mpg)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = \"lm\",\n    color = \"#789F90\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot() command also works when you do not have 2 continuous variables, and instead have one categorical variable paired with one continuous variable. However, the plot is not as adequate as others are in inferring the relationship from the variables.\nFor example, the plot below would be better served as a boxplot.\n\n\nplot(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$cyl)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nboxplot(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$cyl)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing ggplot, we would have the same issue. Since vs is a categorical variable, it does not look right when we use the geom_point() later.\n\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, we would want the geom_boxplot() layer like shown below. The geom_smooth() is also not an applicable layer to a boxplot and would need to be removed.\n\nWhen you create multiple boxplots in ggplot2 and one or more variables are numeric but not converted to factors, only one boxplot may show up because ggplot2 treats numeric variables as continuous. Boxplots group data by categorical variables, so if your variable is continuous, ggplot interprets it as a single category and produces only one boxplot.\nBelow, we still have an error.\n\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) + geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething still is not quite right here, so we would need to make sure cyl is correctly a factor before making the boxplot. Now, we should see multiple boxplots, one for each categorical level. To fix this, you need to convert the grouping variable to a factor using as.factor() in your data, so ggplot will recognize it as a categorical variable and display multiple boxplots accordingly.\n\n\nmtcars &lt;- mtcars %&gt;%\n    mutate(cyl = as.factor(cyl))\nggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) + geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.3.2 Try to Recreate\n\nYou try examples of scatterplots using the UScrime data set that is part of the MASS package to examine a few relationships using ggplot2. A few examples are below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee what information you can take away from the scatterplots above and create some more to practice.",

    "text": "5.5 Full Example Using nhanes Dataset\n\nA big example of where charts are helpful is to explore the nhanes dataset, which is actually a dataset related to auditory issues, in which the number of guns fired is a variable.\nSpecifically, AUQ060 refers to “Hear a whisper from across a quiet room?” AUQ070 refers to “Hear normal voice across a quiet room?” and AUQ080 refers to “Hear a shout from across a quiet room?” While AUQ300 refers to “Ever used firearms for any reason? AUQ310 refers to”How many total rounds ever fired?” and AUQ320 refers to “Wear hearing protection when shooting?” I got these references at the following website: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2011-2012/AUQ_G.htm.\nIt would be interesting to determine whether there is a relationship between hearing loss and gun use. Below, I clean the data set and make some charts. All variables are categorical, and I only look at 2 categorical variables at a time - one auditory related (AUQ 060, 070, 080) and one gun related (AUQ 300, 310, 320).\nThe first step is data cleaning, and in particular recoding the variables of interest. We did some of these before. Let’s also filter out the unused variables using the select statement.\n\nThe select statement in dplyr has a conflict with the select statement in MASS. Since we used MASS earlier, we have to specify which package we want to use select from. We want to use select from dplyr, so we add dplyr:: before the function.\n\n\nnhanes &lt;- read.csv(\"data/nhanes2012.csv\")\n# summary(nhanes)\n\nnhanes.clean &lt;- nhanes %&gt;%\n    dplyr::select(AUQ300, AUQ310, AUQ320, AUQ060, AUQ070, AUQ080) %&gt;%\n    mutate(AUQ300 = recode_factor(AUQ300, `1` = \"Yes\", `2` = \"No\")) %&gt;%\n    mutate(AUQ310 = recode_factor(AUQ310, `1` = \"1 to less than 100\", `2` = \"100 to less than 1000\",\n        `3` = \"1000 to less than 10k\", `4` = \"10k to less than 50k\", `5` = \"50k or more\",\n        `7` = \"Refused\", `9` = \"Don't know\")) %&gt;%\n    mutate(AUQ060 = recode_factor(AUQ060, `1` = \"Yes\", `2` = \"No\")) %&gt;%\n    mutate(AUQ070 = recode_factor(AUQ070, `1` = \"Yes\", `2` = \"No\")) %&gt;%\n    mutate(AUQ080 = recode_factor(AUQ080, `1` = \"Yes\", `2` = \"No\")) %&gt;%\n    mutate(AUQ320 = recode_factor(AUQ320, `1` = \"Always\", `2` = \"Usually\",\n        `3` = \"About half the time\", `4` = \"Seldom\", `5` = \"Never\"))\nsummary(nhanes.clean)\n\n  AUQ300                       AUQ310                     AUQ320    \n Yes :1613   1 to less than 100   : 701   Always             : 583  \n No  :3061   100 to less than 1000: 423   Usually            : 152  \n NA's:4690   1000 to less than 10k: 291   About half the time: 123  \n             10k to less than 50k : 106   Seldom             : 110  \n             50k or more          :  66   Never              : 642  \n             Don't know           :  26   NA's               :7754  \n             NA's                 :7751                             \n  AUQ060      AUQ070      AUQ080    \n Yes :2128   Yes : 564   Yes : 159  \n No  : 745   No  : 210   No  :  53  \n NA's:6491   NA's:8590   NA's:9152  \n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \n\n\n\nFrom here, NA’s are an issue, but we don’t want to broadly omit because it would slice down our dataset too much. I am going to leave them in and handle it on a chart by chart basis.\nThe most applicable chart to graph 2 categorical variables is a barchart. This requires calculating frequencies, and then graphing. Using ggplot, the frequencies are calculated automatically.\n\n\nnhanes.clean %&gt;%\n    drop_na(AUQ310) %&gt;%\n    drop_na(AUQ060) %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = AUQ310, fill = AUQ060)) + geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") +\n    labs(x = \"How many rounds have you fired\", title = \"Hearing Whisper Across Room vs. Num Rounds Fired\",\n        y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnhanes.clean %&gt;%\n    drop_na(AUQ310) %&gt;%\n    drop_na(AUQ070) %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = AUQ310, fill = AUQ070)) + geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") +\n    labs(x = \"How many rounds have you fired\", title = \"Hearing Normal Across Room vs. Num Rounds Fired\",\n        y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnhanes.clean %&gt;%\n    drop_na(AUQ310) %&gt;%\n    drop_na(AUQ080) %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = AUQ310, fill = AUQ080)) + geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") +\n    labs(x = \"How many rounds have you fired\", title = \"Hearing Shout Across Room vs. Num Rounds Fired\",\n        y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n############# Wear hearing protection when shooting\nnhanes.clean %&gt;%\n    drop_na(AUQ320) %&gt;%\n    drop_na(AUQ060) %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = AUQ320, fill = AUQ060)) + geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") +\n    labs(x = \"Wear hearing protection when shooting\", title = \"Hearing Whisper Across Room vs. Use of Hearing Protection\",\n        y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnhanes.clean %&gt;%\n    drop_na(AUQ320) %&gt;%\n    drop_na(AUQ070) %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = AUQ320, fill = AUQ070)) + geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") +\n    labs(x = \"Wear hearing protection when shooting\", title = \"Hearing Normal Across Room vs. Use of Hearing Protection\",\n        y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnhanes.clean %&gt;%\n    drop_na(AUQ310) %&gt;%\n    drop_na(AUQ080) %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = AUQ310, fill = AUQ080)) + geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") +\n    labs(x = \"Wear hearing protection when shooting\", title = \"Hearing Shout Across Room vs. Use of Hearing Protection\",\n        y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is a few of the charts. See if you can determine anything interesting from them and also try to run the other combinations. You will see that it is easier to see with less categories when you have multiple variables like this.",

This journey began with the basics of R, emphasizing that while multiple methods exist to achieve the same results in R, it’s crucial to find the approach that works best for you. As we learn R, you will get used to doing things your way to be able to slice and evaluate the data to find rich information from the data sets we look at. As long as the data was handled properly, it does not matter how we reach our goal using R as long as we do it ourselves.\nMastering R allows you to effectively clean, analyze, and interpret data, unlocking valuable insights from various datasets. We explored the essential practice of data cleaning, learning various techniques and popular functions within the dplyr package under the tidyverse. Proper data cleaning ensures the integrity and accuracy of your analysis. We delved into skewness, kurtosis, variables, and scales of measurement, focusing on summarizing qualitative and quantitative data. Visualizations were introduced as powerful tools to describe variables and uncover patterns in the data.\nWe examined basic probability rules were covered alongside binomial and continuous distributions. We examined the normal distribution, its limitations, and methods for transforming non-normal variables. Central limit theorem is discussed with the Empirical rule alongside normal distributions.\n\nThis book has equipped you with the foundational skills needed to handle data before deeply analyzing it using R. Remember, the key to mastering these techniques lies in consistent practice and finding the methods that best suit your analytical style.",

    "text": "6.1 Some Common Statistics Terms\n\nStatistical inference is one of the foundational ideas in statistics. Since it is often impossible to collect information on every single person or organization, scientists take samples of people or organizations and examine the observations in the sample. Inferential statistics are then used to take the information from the sample and use it to understand (or infer to) the population. In conducting probability calculations, we can make inferences to understand the probability associated with the population.\nResearchers often work with samples instead of populations, where samples are subsets of different populations. In the case of the state data on opioid policies that your book discusses, all states are included, so this is the entire population of states. Statisticians sample from the population to understand the probabilities associated with it.\nWhen selecting a sample, we hope to select a representative sample from the population, and use properties of the normal distribution to understand what is likely happening in the whole population. A normal distribution is one of the most fundamental distributions to use in calculating probabilities. We will look at both discrete and normal distributions, but also seek to understand how a normal distribution and the central limit theorem can help us shed light on many statistics we are inferring.",

    "section": "6.2 Probability Distribution",
    "text": "6.2 Probability Distribution\n\nA probability distribution is the numeric or visual representation of the set of probabilities that each value or range of values of a variable occurs.\nTwo important characteristics:\n\nThe probability of each real value of some variable is non-negative. Instead, it is either 0 or positive. More specifically, the probability of each value x is a value between 0 and 1. Or equivalently. \\(0 &lt;= P(X=x) &lt;= 1\\).\nThe sum of the probabilities of all possible values of a variable is 1.\n\nConsider the probability distribution that reflects the number of credit cards that a bank’s customers carry.\n\n\n\n  NumberOfCards Percentage\n1             0       2.5%\n2             1       9.8%\n3             2      16.6%\n4             3      16.5%\n5     4 or more       54.6\n\n\n\nGiven the characteristics of a probability distribution, we can ask whether this is a valid probability distribution.\n\nYes, because \\(0 &lt;= P(X=x) &lt;= 1\\) and the sum of the percentages is 1.\n\n\n0.025 + 0.098 + 0.166 + 0.165 + 0.546\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nSecond, with the information in the table, we can calculate a number of things, like the probability that a reader carries no credit cards.\n\n\\(P(X=0)= .025\\)\n\nThe probability that a reader carries fewer than two credit cards.\n\n\\(P(X&lt;2)= P(X=0)+P(X=1)= .025 +.098= .123\\)\n\nThe probability that a reader carries at least two credit cards.\n\n\\(P(X&gt;=2) = P(X=2)+P(X=3)+P(X=4)  = .166+.165+.546= .877\\)\nOr \\(1-P(X&lt;2) = 1-.123 = .877\\)\n\nBecause of the 2 characteristics of a probability distribution, sometimes there are a couple ways to calculate the correct answer, like we did above with either calculating probabilities associated with above a value, or beneath and equal to a value knowing that the total sum of all probabilities is 1.\nWhen you produce a percentage, you multiple the calculated probability by 100, so instead of finding a value between 0 and 1, you find a percentage between 0% and 100%. This means that if you use the pnorm function to calculate a probability, you can multiple that probability by 100 to get the percentage.\nWhen you produce the value given a probability calculation, you multiply the probability calculated by the sample size (n).\n\n\n6.2.1 Random Variables\n\nA Random Variable is a function that assigns numerical values to the outcomes of a random experiment.\nDenoted by uppercase letters (e.g., \\(X\\) ).\nCorresponding values of the random variable: \\(x_1,x_2, x_3,...\\)\nRandom variables may be classified as:\n\nDiscrete - The random variable assumes a countable number of distinct values.\n\n\nDiscrete probability distributions show probabilities for variables that can only have certain values, which includes categorical variables and variables that must be measured in whole numbers like number of people texting during class.\nThe Binomial Distribution is a discrete distribution that evaluates the probability of a “yes” or “no” outcome occurring over a given number of trials\n\n\nContinuous - The random variable is characterized by (infinitely) uncountable values within any interval.\n\n\nContinuous probability distributions show probabilities for values, or ranges of values, of a continuous variable that can take any value in some range.\nThe Normal Distribution is a continuous distribution and is the most important of all probability distributions. Its graph is bell-shaped and this bell-shaped curve is used in almost all disciplines.\n\nFor example, consider an experiment in which two shirts are selected from the production line and each is either defective (D) or non-defective (N).\n\nSince only 2 shirts are selected, here is the sample space, which are all the available options: \\({(D,D), (D,N), (N,D), (N,N)}\\)\nThe random variable X is the number of defective shirts.\nThe possible number of defective shirts is the set \\(X={0,1,2}\\),\nSince these are the only countable number of possible outcomes, this is a discrete random variable.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Useful Commands for Random Variables\n\nset.seed() command is useful when conducting random sampling since it will result in the same sample to be taken each time the code is run, which makes sampling more reproducible.\n\nWe briefly looked at this when making our density plot with random normal data using the rnorm() command.\n\nsample_n() command can be used to take a sample. The arguments for sample_n() are size = which is where to put the size of the sample to take and replace = which is where you choose whether or not you want R to sample with replacement (replacing each value into the population after selection, so that it could be selected again) or without replacement (leaving a value out of the sampling after selection).\nLet’s look at an example using the pdmp_2017.csv file.\n\n\n# Load tidyverse\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\nBelow, I am using the read.csv() command to read in the data set and use strings as factors = TRUE to ensure character variables are coerced as factors. This helps bypass the need to coerce later on. We do need to note that it will change all string variables to factors with the TRUE parameter.\n\n\nopioidpolicy  &lt;- read.csv(\"data/pdmp_2017.csv\", stringsAsFactors = TRUE) \n# Set a starting value for sampling\nset.seed(3)\n# Sample 25 states and save as sample and check summary\nSample &lt;- sample_n(opioidpolicy, size=25, replace=FALSE) \nsummary(Sample$Required.Use.of.Prescription.Drug.Monitoring.Programs)\n\n No Yes \n  8  17 \n\n\n\nYou should have the same answers as I do above (8 No’s, and 17 Yes’s) because we set the same seed. If you don’t, I mention the reason below at the end of this short sampling experiment.\n\n\n# Sample another 25 states and check summary.\n# Note the different answer than above. \nSample &lt;- sample_n(opioidpolicy, size=25, replace=FALSE) \nsummary(Sample$Required.Use.of.Prescription.Drug.Monitoring.Programs)\n\n No Yes \n 14  11 \n\n\n\n# Sample another 25 states and check summary\n# Again, note the differences in numbers each time. \nSample &lt;- sample_n(opioidpolicy, size=25, replace=FALSE) \nsummary(Sample$Required.Use.of.Prescription.Drug.Monitoring.Programs)\n\n No Yes \n 12  13 \n\n\n\n# Sample another 25 states and check summary using same set seed as our first run (3). \nset.seed(3)\nSample &lt;- sample_n(opioidpolicy, size=25, replace=FALSE) \nsummary(Sample$Required.Use.of.Prescription.Drug.Monitoring.Programs)\n\n No Yes \n  8  17 \n\n\n\nAgain, you should have the same numbers as I do above, and these numbers should be equivalent to our first run (8 No’s, and 17 Yes’s).

In the case of one random variable, that means: \\(E(X) = \\mu = \\sum{x_iP(X=x_i)}\\)\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3.2 Variance\n\nVariance of a random variable is the average of the squared differences from the mean.\n\nFor a discrete random variable \\(X\\) with values \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, ...\\) that occur with probabilities \\(P(X=x_i)\\), the variance is defined as: \\(Var(X) = \\sigma^2 = \\sum{(x_i-\\mu)^2*P(X=x_i)}\\)\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3.3 Standard Deviation\n\nStandard deviation is consistently the square root of the variance. \\(SD(X) = \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2} = \\sqrt{\\sum{(x_i-\\mu)^2*P(X=x_i)}}\\)\n\n\n\n\n6.2.4 Example of Summary Measures for a Random Variable\n\ndefectdata &lt;- read.csv(\"data/defects.csv\")\nhead(defectdata)\n\n  SerialNumber NumDefects\n1            1          6\n2            2          6\n3            3          0\n4            4          1\n5            5          6\n6            6          6\n\nstr(defectdata)\n\n'data.frame':   500 obs. of  2 variables:\n $ SerialNumber: int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n $ NumDefects  : int  6 6 0 1 6 6 7 0 3 2 ...\n\n# Calculate the probability of the defective pixels per monitor for\n# each member of the sample space [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].\nsampleSpace &lt;- 0:7\nfrequency &lt;- table(defectdata$NumDefects)\nfrequency\n\n\n 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 \n49 47 62 83 60 65 66 68 \n\nproportions &lt;- prop.table(frequency)\nproportions\n\n\n    0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7 \n0.098 0.094 0.124 0.166 0.120 0.130 0.132 0.136 \n\ncumulativeproportions &lt;- cumsum(prop.table(proportions))\ncumulativeproportions\n\n    0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7 \n0.098 0.192 0.316 0.482 0.602 0.732 0.864 1.000 \n\n\n\nOnce we calculate vectors for the frequency table, we bind them together and transpose them into columns and combine them into a data frame.\n\n\nDefects &lt;- t(rbind(sampleSpace, frequency, proportions, cumulativeproportions))\nDefects &lt;- as.data.frame(Defects)\nstr(Defects)\n\n'data.frame':   8 obs. of  4 variables:\n $ sampleSpace          : num  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n $ frequency            : num  49 47 62 83 60 65 66 68\n $ proportions          : num  0.098 0.094 0.124 0.166 0.12 0.13 0.132 0.136\n $ cumulativeproportions: num  0.098 0.192 0.316 0.482 0.602 0.732 0.864 1\n\n\n\nNext, we calculate summary statistics based on the formulas above.\n\n\n# How many defects should the manufacturer expect per monitor?

    "text": "6.3 The Binomial Distribution\n\nThe binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution and applies to probability for binary categorical variables with specific characteristics.\nProperties of a binomial random variable:\n\nA variable is measured in the same way \\(n\\) times, signifying that \\(n\\) is the sample size.\nThere are only two possible values of the variable, often called “success” and “failure”\nEach observed value is independent of the others.\nThe probability of “success”, \\(p\\), and the probability of “failure”, \\(1-p\\), is the same for each observation, so each time the trial is repeated, the probabilities of success and failure remain the same.\nThe random variable is the number of successes in \\(n\\) measurements.\n\n\n\n6.3.1 Summary Measures for a Binomial Random Variable\n\nExpected value, variance, and standard deviation were introduced and defined in section 2. We can take derivatives of the formulas to simplify our calculations given knowing a \\(n\\) and \\(p\\).\nThe formula for the expected value of a binomial random variable expands from \\(\\sum{x_iP(X=x_i)}\\) to \\(= n*p\\).\nThe variance of a binomial random variable expands from \\(\\sum{(x_i-\\mu)^2*P(X=x_i)}\\) to \\(= n*p*(1-p)\\)\nThe standard deviation a binomial random variable expands from \\(\\sqrt{\\sum{(x_i-\\mu)^2*P(X=x_i)}}\\) to \\(= \\sqrt{np*(1-p)}\\)\nExample summary statistics of a binomial random variable\n\nA current WM student has a career free-throw percentage of 89.4%. Suppose he shoots six free throws in tonight’s game. What is the expected number of free throws that he will make?\n\n\nex &lt;- 6 * 0.894\nex\n\n[1] 5.364\n\nvarx &lt;- 6 * 0.894 * (1 - 0.894)\nvarx\n\n[1] 0.568584\n\nsdx &lt;- sqrt(varx)\nsdx\n\n[1] 0.7540451\n\n\nIf the student shoots 6 free throws and typically makes 89.4% of them, we can multiply those two values together for the expected value, 5.364. We also find that this data has a variance of .568584 and standard deviation of .754051.\n\n\n\n6.3.2 The Probability Mass Function\n\nThe Probability Mass Function for a discrete random variable X is a list of the values of X with the associated probabilities, that is, the list of all possible pairs: \\((X, P(X=x))\\)\n\nA probability mass function computes the probability that an exact number of successes happens for a discrete random variable, given \\(n\\) and \\(p\\) defined above.\nDistribution of probabilities of different numbers of successes.\nA probability mass function is used to describe discrete random variables in a binomial distribution.\nEvery random variable is associated with a probability distribution that describes the variable completely.\nUses dbinom() command to calculate in R.\n\nExample using the probability mass function: Approximately 20% of U.S. workers are afraid that they will never be able to retire. Suppose 10 workers are randomly selected. What is the probability that none of the workers is afraid that they will never be able to retire?\nAgain, we can use the dbinom() command to calculate this in R given x = none or 0, size = 10 workers, or just 10, and prob = 20% or .2. We write this command as listed below.\n\n\n\n# P(X=0)\ndbinom(0, 10, 0.2)\n\n[1] 0.1073742\n\n\n\nThe answer suggests that there is a .107 or 10.737% chance that no workers think they won’t be able to retire.\n\n\n\n6.3.3 Cumulative Distribution Function\n\nAnother way to look at a probability distribution is to examine its cumulative probability distribution. Here, you can determine the probability of getting some range of values, which is often more useful than finding the probability of one specific number of successes.\nA cumulative distribution function may be used to describe either discrete or continuous random variables.\n\nThe cumulative distribution function for X is defined as: \\(P(X&lt;=x)\\)\nThe less than and equal to sign is the standard way to look at the cumulative distribution function. You can calculate &gt;, &gt;=, &lt; from \\(P(X&lt;=x)\\) given the two rules of probability discussed above.\n\n\\(0 &lt;= P(X=x) &lt;= 1\\)\nThe sum of the probabilities of all possible values of a variable is 1\n\nUses pbinom() command to calculate in R with the default value of lower.tail = TRUE is for n or fewer successes\nCan change lower.tail parameter to lower.tail = FALSE is computing higher than n rather than n or higher.\n\nExample using the cumulative distribution function, Approximately 20% of U.S. workers are afraid that they will never be able to retire. Suppose 10 workers are randomly selected. What is the probability that less than 3 of the workers are afraid that they will never be able to retire?\nWe can use the pbinom() command to calculate this in R given q = less than 3 or &lt;=2, size = 10 workers, or just 10, and prob = 20% or .2. We write this command as listed below.\n\n\n# P(X&lt;3) or P(X&lt;=2)\npbinom(2, 10, 0.2)\n\n[1] 0.6777995\n\n\n\nOr likewise, we could use multiple dbinom() commands to get individual probabilities and add them up. This statement is much longer, but does give you the same answer. Examine the figure below to see why.\n\n\n\ndbinom(0, 10, 0.2) + dbinom(1, 10, 0.2) + dbinom(2, 10, 0.2)\n\n[1] 0.6777995\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual of Binomial Distribution Example\n\n\n\n\n6.3.4 Variations in binom() Command\n\nIn order to find \\(P(X = 70)\\) given 100 trials and .68 probability of success, we enter:\n\n\n# P(X = 70)\ndbinom(70, 100, 0.68)\n\n[1] 0.07907911\n\n\n\nIn order to find \\(P(X &lt;= 70)\\), given 100 trials and .68 probability of success, we enter:\n\n\n# P(X &lt;= 70)\npbinom(70, 100, 0.68)\n\n[1] 0.7006736\n\n\n\nIn order to find \\(P(X &lt; 70)\\), given 100 trials and .68 probability of success, we enter:\n\n\n# P(X &lt; 70)\npbinom(69, 100, 0.68)\n\n[1] 0.6215945\n\n\n\nIn order to find \\(P(X &gt; 70)\\), given 100 trials and .68 probability of success, we enter:\n\n\n# P(X &gt; 70)\npbinom(70, 100, 0.68, lower.tail = FALSE)\n\n[1] 0.2993264\n\n\n\nIn order to find \\(P(X &gt;= 70)\\), given 100 trials and .68 probability of success, we enter:\n\n\n# P(X &gt;= 70)\npbinom(69, 100, 0.68, lower.tail = FALSE)  #Or\n\n[1] 0.3784055\n\n1 - pbinom(69, 100, 0.68)\n\n[1] 0.3784055\n\n\n\nExamples of binomial distribution calculations in a word problems: A current WM student has a career free-throw percentage of 90.3%.

    "text": "6.4 The Continuous Distribution\n\nProperties of a Continuous Random Variable\n\nThe random variable is characterized by (infinitely) uncountable values within any interval.\nBecause of the definition infinite uncountable, When computing probabilities for a continuous random variable, \\(P(X=x)=0\\)\nTherefore, we cannot assign a nonzero probability to each infinitely uncountable value and still have the probabilities sum to one.\nThus, \\(P(X=a)\\) and \\(P(X=b)\\) both equal zero, and the following holds for continuous random variables: \\(P(a &lt;= X &lt;= b) = P(a &lt; X &lt; b) = P(a &lt;= X &lt; b) = P(a &lt; X &lt;= b)\\).\n\nThis is important to consider and compare to discrete probability.\n\n\n6.4.1 Density Functions for Continuous Distributions\n\n6.4.1.1 Probability Density Function\n\nThe Probability Density Function is used to describe continuous random variables.\nProbability Density Function \\(f(x)\\) of a continuous random variable X describes the relative likelihood that \\(X\\) assumes a value within a given interval (e.g., \\(P(a&lt;=X&lt;=b)\\), where \\(f(x)&gt;=0\\) for all possible values of \\(X\\) and the area under \\(f(x)\\) over all values of \\(x\\) equals one.\n\n\n\n6.4.1.2 Cumulative Density Function\n\nThe Cumulative Density Function \\(F(x)\\) of a continuous random variable X suggests that for any value x of the random variable X, the cumulative distribution function \\(F(x)\\) is computed as, \\(F(x) = P(X &lt;= x)\\) as a result, \\(P(a&lt;=X&lt;=b) = F(b)- F(a)\\).\nThe goal of cumulative distributions is to find the area under the curve. The pnorm() function computes the probability at point q to find the area under the curve.\n\nThree arguments of the pnorm() command:\n\n\nq is the value of interest;\nThe mean (mean);\nThe standard deviation (sd);\n\nAlso an optional lower.tail parameter, which is defaulted to TRUE signifying &lt; or &lt;=.\nWe can also work backwards to find a value given a probability. The qnorm() function computes the quantile value at p to find the value associated with a probability.\n\nThree arguments of the qnorm() command:\n\n\np is the cumulative probability;\nThe mean (mean);\nThe standard deviation (sd);\n\nAlso an optional lower.tail parameter, which is defaulted to TRUE signifying &lt; or &lt;=.\n\n\n\n\n6.4.2 The Normal Distribution\n\nThe normal distribution serves as the cornerstone of statistical inference.\nData is symmetric about its mean.\nMean=Median=Mode.\nThe distribution is bell-shaped.\nThe distribution is asymptotic, which means that the tails get closer and closer to the horizontal axis, but never touch it.\nClosely approximates the probability distribution of a wide range of random variables, such as the following:\n\nHeights and weights of newborn babies.\nScores on SAT.\nCumulative debt of college graduates.\n\nThe normal distribution is completely described by two parameters: population mean \\(\\mu\\), which describes the central location of the distribution,and population variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), which describes the dispersion of the distribution.\n\n\n\n\nNormal Distribution\n\n\n\nA special case of the normal distribution:\n\nMean is equal to zero (E(Z) = 0).\nStandard deviation is equal to one (SD(Z) = 1).\n\n\n\n# Solving the figure above using the pnorm() command in R.  P(Z&lt;=0)\npnorm(q = 0, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n\n[1] 0.5\n\n# Or the following because the default value of the mean and sd are 0\n# and 1.\npnorm(0)\n\n[1] 0.5\n\n\n\nIf we assume a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, and we are looking for the probability when the mean is 0, we will get a .5 probability or 50 percent (.5*100). This is because the curve is normal with identical sides.\nWe can also solve this backwards. Below is the qnorm() command, which solves the figure above looking at probability instead of values.\n\n\n# P(Z &gt;= z) = .5\nqnorm(0.5, 0, 1)\n\n[1] 0\n\n# Or\nqnorm(0.5)\n\n[1] 0\n\n\n\n\n6.4.3 Empirical Rule\n\nChevyshev’s Theorem states that at least \\(1 - 1/z^2\\)% of the data lies between \\(z\\) standard deviations from the mean. This result does not depend on the shape of the distribution.\nWith a normal distribution, we can assume approximately the following under the empirical rule:\n\n68% of values within one SD of the mean;\n95% of values within two SD of the mean;\n99.7% of values within three SD of the mean.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmpirical Rule\n\n\n\n\n6.4.4 Calculating z-scores\n\nA z-score allows description and comparison of where an observation falls compared to the other observations for a normally distributed variable.\nA z-score is calculated as the number of standard deviations an observation is away from the mean.\nA normally distributed variable can be used to create z-scores.\nPurpose: This formula calculates the z-score of an individual data point.\nInterpretation: It tells us how many standard deviations a specific value \\(x\\) is from the mean of the dataset.\nThe \\(x_i\\) represents the value of variable \\(x\\) for a single observation, \\(\\mu_x\\) is the mean of the \\(x\\) variable, \\(\\sigma_x\\) is the standard deviation of the \\(x\\) variable. So, \\(z_i\\) is the difference between the observation value and the mean value for a variable and is converted by the denominator into standard deviations. The final z-score for an observation is the number of standard deviations it is from the mean. \\[z_i = (x_i - \\mu_x)/\\sigma_x\\].\nA z score or z value specifies by how many standard deviations the corresponding x value falls above (z &gt; 0) or below (z &lt; 0) the mean.\n\nA positive z indicates by how many standard deviations the corresponding x lies above mean.\nA zero z indicates that the corresponding x equals mean.\nA negative z indicates by how many standard deviations the corresponding x lies below mean.\n\nExample of a z-score calculation: Scores on a management aptitude exam are normally distributed with a mean of 72 and a standard deviation of 8.\n\nWhat is the probability that a randomly selected manager will score above 60?\nFirst, we could transform the random variable X to Z score using the transformation formula:\n\n\n\n(60 - 72)/8\n\n[1] -1.5\n\n\n\nThen, you can calculate the probability using the standard normal distribution, which has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n\n\n# P(Z &gt; -1.5)\npnorm(-1.5, 0, 1, lower.tail = FALSE)\n\n[1] 0.9331928\n\n# Or similarly, we could use the line below because of the default\n# values associated with the pnorm() command\npnorm(-1.5, lower.tail = FALSE)\n\n[1] 0.9331928\n\n\n\nAlso, because R handles the standard normal transformation on our behalf with its inclusion of parameters, we can use the pnorm() command with the mean and standard deviation provided above to calculate the probability in less steps.\n\n\n# Note the same answer as above.

    "section": "",
    "text": "CLT refers to the fact that, in many situations, when independent random variables are summed up, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed. Therefore, CLT suggests that for any population X with expected value \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) the sampling distribution of \\(X\\) will be approximately normal if the sample size \\(n\\) is sufficiently large.\nThe CLT tells us that, regardless of the original distribution of a population, the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger. We use the CLT when we want to estimate population parameters (like the mean) from sample data and apply techniques that rely on normality, such as confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. This allows us to make inferences about the population using the normal distribution even when the population itself isn’t normally distributed.\nThe Central Limit Theorem (CLT) holds true for continuous variables, regardless of whether they are normally distributed or not. Generally, the normal distribution approximation is justified when the sample size is sufficiently large, typically \\(n≥30\\). If the sample means are approximately normal, we can transform them into a standard normal form. The standard deviation of the sample means (also called the standard error) can be estimated using the population standard deviation and the sample size that makes up the distribution.\nIf \\(\\bar{X}\\) is approximately normal, then we can transform it using an updated formula of the z-score formula with standard error \\(𝑍=(𝑋- \\mu)/(\\sigma/\\sqrt(n))\\)\nNext, we want to create an experiment where we simulate why the CLT holds true. The rnorm() command pulls random data from a normal distribution. However, even when the sample is small, it can appear not normal - even though it is from a normal distribution.\n\n\n\nIf we increase the sample size, we should all see a nice normal bell shape distribution like the one below.\n\n\n\nThe x limits are set from -3 to 3 because a normal distribution follows the empirical rule discussed above (almost all data is within 3 sd of the mean).\nRelating this to the CLT, the CLT states that the sum or mean of a large number of independent observations from the same underlying distribution has an approximate normal distribution. If we were to take a 6 sided dice, in any given roll, we would expect the average. This means that the expected value E(X) will be the mean as discussed above.\n\n\n\nRolling a dice only one time would not give us enough data to assume a normal distribution under the CLT. However, if we were to roll a higher number of times, and repeat that experiment \\(n\\) number of times, we would expect that as \\(n\\) grows, we would approach a normal distribution.\n\n\n\nNext, if we repeat the dice roll experiment that we ran 1,000 times above, we can see the normal distribution start to take shape. The example below has a loop for simulation purposes. This loop rolls x with allowed values 1 to 6 - 1,000 times - and then does that 100 times. The more we do this, the closer we get to approximating the mean (3.5) as our histogram starts to get more narrow.\n\n\n\nImportant to note that for any sample size \\(n\\), the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar{x}\\) is normal if the population X from which the sample is drawn is normally distributed, meaning, there is no need to use CLT.",

    "text": "6.6 Standard Error (SE)\n\nThe \\(SE\\) is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution for all samples of size \\(n\\).\nIt is unusual to have the entire population for computing the population standard deviation, and it is also unusual to have a large number of samples from one population. A close approximation to this value is called the standard error of the mean. \\(SE=sd/\\sqrt(n)\\).\nStandard Deviation vs. Standard Error\n\nSD: Measure of variability in the sample.\nSE: Estimate of how closely the sample represents the population.\n\nPurpose: This is the standard error formula used to assess the distribution of sample means around the population mean.\nInterpretation: This measures how much the sample mean, \\(\\bar{X}\\) is expected to vary from the population mean given the sample size \\(n\\).\nThe standard deviation measures the spread of individual data points, while the standard error measures the spread of sample means.\nThe standard deviation and standard error are both measures of variability but are used in different contexts and serve different purposes. The standard deviation quantifies the spread of individual data points within a dataset. It is often used when analyzing the distribution of a single sample or population. On the other hand, the standard error is a measure of the precision of the sample mean in estimating the population mean. It tells us how much the sample mean is likely to vary from the true population mean if we were to take repeated samples. The standard error is derived from the standard deviation but is scaled by the square root of the sample size, meaning it decreases as the sample size increases. This makes it particularly useful in inferential statistics, where it helps assess the accuracy of estimates based on sample data.\nExample using SD: Given that \\(\\mu\\) = 16 inches and \\(\\sigma\\) = 0.8 inches, determine the following: What is the probability that a randomly selected pizza is less than 15.5 inches?\n\n\n# P(X &lt; 15.5)\npnorm(15.5, 16, 0.8)\n\n[1] 0.2659855\n\n\n\nExample using SE: What is the probability that 2 randomly selected pizzas average less than 15.5 inches?\n\n\\(P(\\bar{X} &lt; 15.5)\\)\n\n\npnorm(15.5, 16, 0.8/sqrt(2))\n\n[1] 0.1883796\n\n\nAdditional Examples using SE:\n\nAnne wants to determine if the marketing campaign has had a lingering effect on the amount of money customers spend on coffee.

In doing so, we cleaned the data.\nI copied over that data preparation code in regards to the variable of interest (PHYSHLTH), and tidied it up for one example. To remind ourselves, the question being asked was the following, “Now thinking about your physical health, which includes physical illness and injury, for how many days during the past 30 days was your physical health not good?”\nIf ever you are using the MASS package and dplyr, the select function may have a conflict where R does not know which to use. If you get an error when using select, add dplyr:: in front of the statement to ensure you are using select from dplyr to select variables.\n\n\n#\ngender &lt;- read.csv(\"data/brfss.csv\")\n# Review the data\nsummary(gender)\n\n    TRNSGNDR        X_AGEG5YR          X_RACE         X_INCOMG    \n Min.   :1.000    Min.   : 1.000   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :1.000  \n 1st Qu.:4.000    1st Qu.: 5.000   1st Qu.:1.000   1st Qu.:3.000  \n Median :4.000    Median : 8.000   Median :1.000   Median :5.000  \n Mean   :4.059    Mean   : 7.822   Mean   :1.992   Mean   :4.481  \n 3rd Qu.:4.000    3rd Qu.:10.000   3rd Qu.:1.000   3rd Qu.:5.000  \n Max.   :9.000    Max.   :14.000   Max.   :9.000   Max.   :9.000  \n NA's   :310602                    NA's   :94                     \n    X_EDUCAG        HLTHPLN1         HADMAM          X_AGE80     \n Min.   :1.000   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :1.000    Min.   :18.00  \n 1st Qu.:2.000   1st Qu.:1.000   1st Qu.:1.000    1st Qu.:44.00  \n Median :3.000   Median :1.000   Median :1.000    Median :58.00  \n Mean   :2.966   Mean   :1.108   Mean   :1.215    Mean   :55.49  \n 3rd Qu.:4.000   3rd Qu.:1.000   3rd Qu.:1.000    3rd Qu.:69.00  \n Max.   :9.000   Max.   :9.000   Max.   :9.000    Max.   :80.00  \n                                 NA's   :208322                  \n    PHYSHLTH   \n Min.   : 1.0  \n 1st Qu.:20.0  \n Median :88.0  \n Mean   :61.2  \n 3rd Qu.:88.0  \n Max.   :99.0  \n NA's   :4     \n\n# PHYSHLTH example\ngender.clean &lt;- gender %&gt;%\n    dplyr::select(PHYSHLTH) %&gt;%\n    drop_na() %&gt;%\n    # Turn the 77 values to NA, since 77 meant don't know or not sure\n    # from the brss codebook\nmutate(PHYSHLTH = na_if(PHYSHLTH, y = 77)) %&gt;%\n    # Turn the 99 values to NA, since 99 meant Refuled from the brss\n    # codebook.\nmutate(PHYSHLTH = na_if(PHYSHLTH, y = 99)) %&gt;%\n    # Recode the 88 values to 0 - since the number 88 meant 0 days of\n    # illness from the brss codebook.\nmutate(PHYSHLTH = recode(PHYSHLTH, `88` = 0L))\ntable(gender.clean$PHYSHLTH)\n\n\n     0      1      2      3      4      5      6      7      8      9     10 \n291696  19505  24890  14713   7644  12931   2140   8049   1478    325   9437 \n    11     12     13     14     15     16     17     18     19     20     21 \n   133    908     92   4558   8638    221    153    279     51   5554   1111 \n    22     23     24     25     26     27     28     29     30 \n   132     80     98   2270    149    204    831    390  35701 \n\nsummary(gender.clean)\n\n    PHYSHLTH     \n Min.   : 0.000  \n 1st Qu.: 0.000  \n Median : 0.000  \n Mean   : 4.224  \n 3rd Qu.: 3.000  \n Max.   :30.000  \n NA's   :10299   \n\nqnorm(0.95, mean = 500, sd = 10)\n\n[1] 516.4485\n\n\n\nOnce here, we graph PHYSHLTH.\n\n\n\ngender.clean %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(PHYSHLTH)) + geom_histogram(fill = \"#7463AC\", color = \"white\") +\n    theme_minimal() + labs(x = \"Number of Days Sick\", y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe determined from the descriptive statistics lesson that this variable had severe skewness (positive).

    "section": "4.2 Coercing Data Types",
    "text": "4.2 Coercing Data Types\n\nIn R, coercion is the process of converting one data type to another, often done automatically by R when necessary. For example, if you combine numeric and character data in a vector, R will coerce the numeric values to characters, as seen in c(1, “A”), which results in c(“1”, “A”). Coercion can also be done manually using functions like as.numeric() or as.factor() to change data types explicitly.\nTo determine whether a variable is numeric or categorical (factor), you can use the class() function. For example, if you have a variable age, running class(age) will tell you if it is stored as “numeric” or “factor”. Numeric variables represent quantities, such as continuous or discrete numbers, while categorical variables represent groups or categories, typically stored as factors. For example, a variable with levels like “Male” and “Female” would be a categorical (factor) variable.\n\n\n4.2.1 Factor data type:\n\nOrdinal: Contain categories that have some logical order (e.g. categories of age).\nNominal: Have categories that have no logical order (e.g., religious affiliation and marital status).\nR will treat each unique value of a factor as a different level.\n\n\n4.2.1.1 Ordinal Variable\n\nOrdinal data may be categorized and ranked with respect to some characteristic or trait.\n\nFor example, instructors are often evaluated on an ordinal scale (excellent, good, fair, poor).\nA scale allows us to code the data based on order, assuming equal distance between scale items (aka likert items).\nYou can make an ordinal factor data type in R or you can convert the order to meaningful numbers.\n\nTo recode numbers in R, we would code poor to excellent = 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively.\nThe recode() function from the dplyr package within the tidyverse ecosystem is used to replace specific values in a vector or variable with new values.\nIt allows you to map old values to new ones in a simple and readable manner.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n# Take a vector representing evaluation scores, named evaluate \nevaluate &lt;- c(\"excellent\", \"good\", \"fair\", \"poor\", \"excellent\", \"good\")\n\ndata &lt;- data.frame(evaluate)\ndata &lt;- data %&gt;%\n     mutate(evaluate = recode(evaluate,\n            \"excellent\" = 4,\n            \"good\" = 3,\n            \"fair\" = 2,\n            \"poor\" = 1))\ndata\n\n  evaluate\n1        4\n2        3\n3        2\n4        1\n5        4\n6        3\n\n\n\n\n4.2.1.2 Nominal Variable\n\nWith nominal variables, data are simply categories for grouping.\nFor example, coding race/ethnicity might have a category value of White, Black, Native American, Asian/Pacific Islander, Other.\nQualitative values may be converted to quantitative values for analysis purposes. + White = 1, Black = 2, etc. This conversion to numerical representation of the category would be needed to run some analysis.\n\nSometimes, R does this on our behalf depending on commands used.\n\nWe can force a variable into a factor data type using the as.factor() command.\nIf we use the read.csv() command, we can sometimes do this by setting an argument \\(stringsAsFactors=TRUE\\). We will do this later in the lesson.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Numerical data types:\n\nA numerical data type is a vector of numbers (Real or Integer)\nContinuous (Real) variables can take any value along some continuum, hence continuous.\n\nWe can force a variable into a numerical data type by using the as.numeric() command.\nFor example, we could collect information on a participants age, height, weight, or distance traveled.\n\nTwo ways to create:\n\nWe can create a numeric variable by ensuring our value we assign is a number!\nWe can force a variable into an real number data type by using the as.numeric() command.\n\n\n# Assign Rhode Island limit for medical marijuana in ounces per\n# person\nkOuncesRhode &lt;- 2.5\n# Identify the data type\nclass(x = kOuncesRhode)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\nDiscrete (Integer) Variables:\n\nDiscrete variables can only take a countable number of distinct values.\nWe can force a variable into an integer data type by using the as.integer() command.\n\nFor example, we could collect information on the number of children in a family or number of points scored in a basketball game.\n\n\n# Assign the value of 4 to a constant called kTestInteger and set as\n# an integer\nkTestInteger &lt;- as.integer(4)\nclass(kTestInteger)  #Confirm the data type is an integer \n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n# Use as.integer() to truncate the variable ouncesRhode\nTrunc &lt;- as.integer(kOuncesRhode)\nTrunc\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Character data type\n\nWrapped in either single or double quotation marks.\n\nIncludes letters, words, or numbers that cannot logically be included in calculations (e.g., a zip code).\nA quick example is below that shows how to assign a character value to a variable.\n\n\n\n# Make constants\nkFirstName &lt;- \"Pamela\"\nkLastName &lt;- \"Schlosser\"\n# Check the data type\nclass(x = kFirstName)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n# Create a zip code constant and check the data type\nkZipCode &lt;- \"23185\"\nclass(x = kZipCode)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\n\n4.2.4 Logical data type\n\nValues of TRUE and FALSE\nResult of some expression.\n\nA quick example is below that shows how to assign a logical value to a variable.\n\n\n# Store the result of 6 &gt; 8 in a constant called kSixEight\nkSixEight &lt;- 6 &gt; 8\n# Can use comparison tests with the following == &gt;= &lt;= &gt; &lt; &lt;&gt; !=\nkSixEight  # Print kSixEight\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n# Determine the data type of kSixEight\nclass(x = kSixEight)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.5 Date data type\n\nA variable that should be a date.\n\n\n# Convert date info in format 'mm/dd/yyyy' using as.Date\nstrDates &lt;- c(\"01/05/1965\", \"08/16/1975\")\ndates &lt;- as.Date(strDates, \"%m/%d/%Y\")\nstr(dates)\n\n Date[1:2], format: \"1965-01-05\" \"1975-08-16\"\n\n\n\nlubridate is a package specifically for converting dates. This package makes dates a lot easier to work with.\n\n\n# Convert date info in format 'mm/dd/yyyy' using lubridate\nlibrary(lubridate)\nstrDates &lt;- c(\"01/05/1965\", \"08/16/1975\")\ndates &lt;- mdy(strDates)\nstr(dates)\n\n Date[1:2], format: \"1965-01-05\" \"1975-08-16\"\n\n\n\nIf you are only given a year and a month, you can use the ym() command to turn it to a date. But take note that it will add a day to the value as a placeholder.\n\n\n# Convert date info in format 'yyyymm' using lubridate\nstryyyymm &lt;- c(\"202201\", \"202003\", \"202204\")\ndates &lt;- ym(stryyyymm)\nstr(dates)\n\n Date[1:3], format: \"2022-01-01\" \"2020-03-01\" \"2022-04-01\"\n\n\n\n\n4.2.6 Nominal Example with Dataset\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ngss.2016 &lt;- read_csv(file = \"data/gss2016.csv\")\n\n\n# Examine the variable types with summary and class functions.\nsummary(gss.2016)\n\n    grass               age           \n Length:2867        Length:2867       \n Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n\nclass(gss.2016$grass)  #Check the data type.\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\ngss.2016$grass &lt;- as.factor(gss.2016$grass)  #Turn to a factor.\nclass(gss.2016$grass)  #Confirming it is now correct.\n\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n\n\n\n4.2.7 Numerical Example with Dataset\n\nWe need to ensure data can be coded as numeric before using the as.numeric() command. For example, to handle the variable age, it seems like numerical values except one value of “89 OR OLDER”. If as.numeric() command was used on this variable, it would put all the 89 and older observations as NAs. To force it to be a numerical variable, and keep that the sample participants were the oldest value, we need to recode it and then use the as.numeric() command to coerce it into a number.\nRecoding the 89 and older to 89 does cause the data to lack integrity in its current form because it will treat the people over 89 years old as 89. But, we are limited here because this needs to be a numerical variable for us to proceed. We will learn a step later on in this section to transform the age variable into categories so that we bring back our data integrity.\n\n\nclass(gss.2016$age)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n# Recode '89 OR OLDER' into just '89'\ngss.2016$age &lt;- recode(gss.2016$age, `89 OR OLDER` = \"89\")\n# Convert to numeric data type\ngss.2016$age &lt;- as.numeric(gss.2016$age)\nsummary(gss.2016)  #Conduct final check confirming correct data types\n\n       grass           age       \n DK       : 110   Min.   :18.00  \n IAP      : 911   1st Qu.:34.00  \n LEGAL    :1126   Median :49.00  \n NOT LEGAL: 717   Mean   :49.16  \n NA's     :   3   3rd Qu.:62.00  \n                  Max.   :89.00  \n                  NA's   :10",

If so, then decouple at least your desktop with OneDrive so you can work off the cloud. Finally, run the lines below one at a time. Once the packages are done installing, then restart your computer. Finally, open RStudio and run a blank RMarkdown file. If this file knits, then your homework should knit as long as there are no other errors.\nYou may only need to update one of these packages.

    "text": "11.1 Factor data type\n\nFactor data types can be ordinal or nominal. Ordinal and nominal variables are both types of categorical variables but differ in their characteristics. Ordinal variables have a meaningful order or ranking among categories (e.g., “low,” “medium,” “high”), but the intervals between ranks are not necessarily equal. Nominal variables, on the other hand, represent categories without any inherent order (e.g., “red,” “blue,” “green”). Understanding this distinction is essential for selecting appropriate statistical methods, as ordinal variables often allow for rank-based analyses, while nominal variables do not.\n\nOrdinal: Contain categories that have some logical order (e.g. categories of age).\nNominal: Have categories that have no logical order (e.g., religious affiliation and marital status).\n\nR will treat each unique value of a factor as a different level.\n\n\n11.1.1 Ordinal Variable\n\nOrdinal data may be categorized and ranked with respect to some characteristic or trait.\n\nFor example, instructors are often evaluated on an ordinal scale (excellent, good, fair, poor).\nA scale allows us to code the data based on order, assuming equal distance between scale items (aka likert items).\nYou can make an ordinal factor data type in R or you can convert the order to meaningful numbers.\n\nTo recode numbers in R, we would code poor to excellent = 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively.\nThe recode() function from the dplyr package within the tidyverse ecosystem is used to replace specific values in a vector or variable with new values.\nIt allows you to map old values to new ones in a simple and readable manner.\nWe will break down the mutate() function and the piping operator a more in the next module. For now, here is an example of how to recode data into numerical values.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n# Take a vector representing evaluation scores, named evaluate \nevaluate &lt;- c(\"excellent\", \"good\", \"fair\", \"poor\", \"excellent\", \"good\")\n\ndata &lt;- data.frame(evaluate)\ndata &lt;- data %&gt;%\n     mutate(evaluate = recode(evaluate,\n            \"excellent\" = 4,\n            \"good\" = 3,\n            \"fair\" = 2,\n            \"poor\" = 1))\ndata\n\n  evaluate\n1        4\n2        3\n3        2\n4        1\n5        4\n6        3\n\n\n\n\n11.1.2 Nominal Variable\n\nWith nominal variables, data are simply categories for grouping.\nFor example, coding race/ethnicity might have a category value of White, Black, Native American, Asian/Pacific Islander, Other.\nQualitative values may be converted to quantitative values for analysis purposes. + White = 1, Black = 2, etc. This conversion to numerical representation of the category would be needed to run some analysis.\n\nSometimes, R does this on our behalf depending on commands used.\n\nWe can force a variable into a factor data type using the as.factor() command.\nIf we use the read.csv() command, we can sometimes do this by setting an argument \\(stringsAsFactors=TRUE\\).

    "section": "11.2 Numerical data type",
    "text": "11.2 Numerical data type\n\n11.2.1 Real Number\n\nIn R, a real number refers to any numerical value that includes both integers and decimals, as opposed to categorical or character data. The as.numeric() function is used to explicitly convert data into numeric format, allowing R to treat it as a real number for calculations. However, if the input to as.numeric() cannot be logically converted (e.g., non-numeric characters), R will return NA with a warning, highlighting the importance of ensuring the input is suitable for numeric conversion.\nThe as.numeric() function takes an input vector, such as characters or factors, and attempts to coerce it into numeric values. For instance, as.numeric(c(“1”, “2”, “3”)) returns a numeric vector of 1, 2, and 3. If applied to factors, it returns the underlying integer codes, not the original levels, so caution is needed to avoid misinterpretation. When conversion is not possible (e.g., as.numeric(“abc”)), it results in NA with a warning.\nA numerical data type is a vector of numbers that can be Real or Integer, where continuous (Real) variables can take any value along some continuum, and integers take on whole numbers.\nTwo ways to create:\n\nWe can create a numeric variable by ensuring our value we assign is a number!\nWe can force a variable into an real number data type by using the as.numeric() command.\n\n\n\n# Assign Rhode Island limit for medical marijuana in ounces per\n# person\nkOuncesRhode &lt;- 2.5\n# Identify the data type\nclass(x = kOuncesRhode)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\n\n\n11.2.2 Integer Number\n\nDiscrete (Integer) Variables: In R, integer discrete data types represent whole numbers, making them ideal for scenarios where only non-fractional values are meaningful, such as counts, rankings, or categorical levels encoded as numbers. Integer values are stored more efficiently than numeric (floating-point) values, providing performance benefits in memory usage and computations. Integers can be explicitly created using the L suffix (e.g., x &lt;- 5L) or by coercing other data types with as.integer(). Operations on integers, such as arithmetic, comparisons, or indexing, behave consistently with their discrete nature. Integer data types are particularly useful for tasks like looping, array indexing, or when working with data where precision beyond whole numbers is unnecessary or irrelevant.\nFor an example of a discrete variable, we could collect information on the number of children in a family or number of points scored in a basketball game.\n\n\n# Assign the value of 4 to a constant called kTestInteger and set as\n# an integer\nkTestInteger &lt;- as.integer(4)\nclass(kTestInteger)  #Confirm the data type is an integer \n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n# Use as.integer() to truncate the variable ouncesRhode\nTrunc &lt;- as.integer(kOuncesRhode)\nTrunc\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n\n11.2.3 Character data type\n\nThe character data type in R is used to store text or string data, making it essential for handling names, labels, descriptions, or any non-numeric information. Character data is represented as sequences of characters enclosed in quotes (e.g., “hello” or ‘world’).\nCharacter data types can be wrapped in either single or double quotation marks (e.g, “hello” or ‘hello’).\nCharacter data types can include letters, words, or numbers that cannot logically be included in calculations (e.g., a zip code).\n\nA quick example is below that shows how to assign a character value to a variable.\n\n\n\n# Make string constants\nQ1 &lt;- \"A\"\nQ2 &lt;- \"B\"\n# Check the data type\nclass(x = Q1)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\n\n11.2.4 Logical data type\n\nLogical data types in R represent values that are either TRUE or FALSE, often used for conditional operations and data filtering. Logical values can be the result of comparisons (e.g., x &gt; 10) or explicitly assigned. Logical vectors are particularly useful in subsetting data; for instance, data[data$column &gt; 5, ] selects rows where the column values are greater than 5. Logical operators like & (and), | (or), and ! (not) allow for more complex conditions. Logical data is also essential in control structures such as if, else, and loops. By enabling dynamic and conditional programming, logical types play a key role in efficient data manipulation and analysis.\n\nA quick example is below that shows how to assign a logical value to a variable.\n\n\n\n# Store the result of 6 &gt; 8 in a constant called kSixEight\nkSixEight &lt;- 6 &gt; 8\n# Can use comparison tests with the following == &gt;= &lt;= &gt; &lt; &lt;&gt; !=\nkSixEight  # Print kSixEight\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n# Determine the data type of kSixEight\nclass(x = kSixEight)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\n\n\n\n11.2.5 Date data type\n\nThe date data type in R is used to represent calendar dates, allowing for accurate storage and manipulation of time-related data. Dates in R are typically stored as objects of class Date, which internally represent the number of days since January 1, 1970. This format facilitates arithmetic operations, such as calculating differences between dates or adding/subtracting days. Dates can be created and manipulated using functions like as.Date() for converting character strings to date objects, or Sys.Date() for retrieving the current date. Handling dates correctly is essential in time series analysis, scheduling, and any task involving chronological data, as improper formatting or assumptions can lead to errors in analysis.\n\n\n# Convert date info in format 'mm/dd/yyyy' using as.Date\nstrDates &lt;- c(\"01/05/1965\", \"08/16/1975\")\ndates &lt;- as.Date(strDates, \"%m/%d/%Y\")\nstr(dates)\n\n Date[1:2], format: \"1965-01-05\" \"1975-08-16\"\n\n\n\nThe lubridate package provides additional tools for working with dates, such as parsing and extracting components like year, month, and day. This package makes dates a lot easier to work with.\n\n\n# Convert date info in format 'mm/dd/yyyy' using lubridate\nlibrary(lubridate)\nstrDates &lt;- c(\"01/05/1965\", \"08/16/1975\")\ndates &lt;- mdy(strDates)\nstr(dates)\n\n Date[1:2], format: \"1965-01-05\" \"1975-08-16\"\n\n\n\nIf you are only given a year and a month, you can use the ym() command to turn it to a date. But take note that it will add a day to the value as a placeholder.\n\n\n# Convert date info in format 'yyyymm' using lubridate\nstryyyymm &lt;- c(\"202201\", \"202003\", \"202204\")\ndates &lt;- ym(stryyyymm)\nstr(dates)\n\n Date[1:3], format: \"2022-01-01\" \"2020-03-01\" \"2022-04-01\"\n\n\n\n# Convert date info in format 'mm/dd/yyyy' using as.Date\nstrDates &lt;- c(\"01/05/1965\", \"08/16/1975\")\ndates &lt;- as.Date(strDates, \"%m/%d/%Y\")\nstr(dates)\n\n Date[1:2], format: \"1965-01-05\" \"1975-08-16\"\n\n\n\nUseDates &lt;- read.csv(\"data/Lubridate.csv\")\nUseDates$Date &lt;- ym(UseDates$Date)\n\n# You can use the month or year function to access the month or year\n# from the date\nUseDates$month &lt;- month(UseDates$Date)\nUseDates$year &lt;- year(UseDates$Date)\n\n## Now, you can access months or year numerically\nsummary(UseDates$month)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

For example, to handle the variable age, it seems like numerical values except one value of “89 OR OLDER”. If as.numeric() command was used on this variable, it would put all the 89 and older observations as NAs. To force it to be a numerical variable, and keep that the sample participants were the oldest value, we need to recode it and then use the as.numeric() command to coerce it into a number.\nRecoding the 89 and older to 89 does cause the data to lack integrity in its current form because it will treat the people over 89 years old as 89. But, we are limited here because this needs to be a numerical variable for us to proceed. We will learn a step later on in this section to transform the age variable into categories so that we bring back our data integrity.\n\n\nclass(gss.2016$age)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n# Recode '89 OR OLDER' into just '89'\ngss.2016$age &lt;- recode(gss.2016$age, `89 OR OLDER` = \"89\")\n# Convert to numeric data type\ngss.2016$age &lt;- as.numeric(gss.2016$age)\nsummary(gss.2016)  #Conduct final check confirming correct data types\n\n       grass           age       \n DK       : 110   Min.   :18.00  \n IAP      : 911   1st Qu.:34.00  \n LEGAL    :1126   Median :49.00  \n NOT LEGAL: 717   Mean   :49.16  \n NA's     :   3   3rd Qu.:62.00  \n                  Max.   :89.00  \n                  NA's   :10",

    "text": "12.1 Limitations of Using a Missing Data Technique\n\nAlways recommend a closer evaluation of missing data.\nThere are limitations of the techniques listed above (omission, imputation, and ignore).\nReduction in Sample Size: Ignoring missing data leads to a smaller effective sample size, which may reduce the power of your analysis and the reliability of the results.\nBias: If the missing data are not Missing Completely at Random, ignoring them may introduce bias. For example, if specific groups or patterns are overrepresented in the remaining data, the results may not generalize to the full dataset.\nDistorted Metrics: Calculations that ignore missing values (e.g., averages, sums) might not reflect the true population parameters, especially if the missing data are systematically different from the observed data. In addition, if a large number of values are missing, mean imputation will likely distort the relationships among variables, leading to biased results.\nIncorrect Inferences: Ignoring missing data without considering its nature could lead to incorrect conclusions, as the analysis only reflects the subset of available data.\nConsider a dataset used to predict factors that lead to intubation due to COVID-19. Suppose one variable, “Number of pregnancies,” contains missing data (NAs) for all men, as the question is not applicable to them. If we were to compare this variable with another, “Intubated due to COVID-19: Yes/No,” simply omitting the rows with blanks (NAs) could lead to the exclusion of an entire gender, distorting the analysis. In this case, a different approach to handling missing data would be more appropriate to ensure the dataset remains representative. Additionally, if a value is not blank but is considered missing for analysis purposes, the data should be consistently processed (e.g., mutated or recoded) to align with the chosen technique for handling true missing values.",

If it is not, then take the time to get the latest version of the software. Second, make sure your files are not on the cloud, including OneDrive. If so, then decouple at least your desktop with OneDrive so you can work off the cloud. Finally, run the lines below one at a time. Once the packages are done installing, then restart your computer. Finally, open RStudio and run a blank RMarkdown file. If this file knits, then your homework should knit as long as there are no other errors.\nYou may only need to update one of these packages. However, since they are all connected, running these commands ensures that they are all up to date with minimal troubleshooting.",

Each layer in a ggplot2 plot can represent different types of data, aesthetics, or annotations, enabling flexibility and control over how data is visualized. Layers can include geometries (e.g., points, lines, bars), statistical summaries, labels, grids, and themes.\nSeparation of Plot Components: Each layer can handle a different part of the plot. For example, one layer may be used for bars, another for labels, and another for a trend line. This allows you to build up a plot step by step.\nCustomization and Enhancement: By adding multiple layers, you can customize different aspects of the plot such as labels, colors, annotations, and theme elements. Each layer can be independently controlled.\nModularity: Layering allows you to modularize your plot construction, making it easier to add, remove, or modify parts of the plot without changing the entire structure.\nCombining Data Sources: Different layers can use different datasets or aesthetics, which is useful when you need to overlay one dataset on top of another (e.g., adding a regression line over a scatter plot).",

For variables that are right skewed, a few transformations that could work to make the variable more normally distributed are: square root, cube root, reciprocal, and log.\nFirst, read in the opioid data set from so we can see a variable that is considered not normal.\n\n\n\n# Distance to substance abuse facility with medication-assisted\n# treatment\ndist.mat &lt;- read.csv(\"data/opioidFacility.csv\")\n# Review the data\nsummary(dist.mat)\n\n    STATEFP         COUNTYFP          YEAR       INDICATOR        \n Min.   : 1.00   Min.   :  1.0   Min.   :2017   Length:3214       \n 1st Qu.:19.00   1st Qu.: 35.0   1st Qu.:2017   Class :character  \n Median :30.00   Median : 79.0   Median :2017   Mode  :character  \n Mean   :31.25   Mean   :101.9   Mean   :2017                     \n 3rd Qu.:46.00   3rd Qu.:133.0   3rd Qu.:2017                     \n Max.   :72.00   Max.   :840.0   Max.   :2017                     \n     VALUE           STATE           STATEABBREVIATION     COUNTY         \n Min.   :  0.00   Length:3214        Length:3214        Length:3214       \n 1st Qu.:  9.25   Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Median : 18.17   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n Mean   : 24.04                                                           \n 3rd Qu.: 31.00                                                           \n Max.   :414.86                                                           \n\n\n\n# Graph the distance variable which is called Value but represents\n# miles.

We cannot see that result yet until we graph these results.\n\nThis requires 4 separate calculations using mutate() commands.\n\n\ndist.mat.cleaned &lt;- dist.mat %&gt;%\n    mutate(miles.cube.root = VALUE^(1/3)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(miles.log = log(x = VALUE)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(miles.inverse = 1/VALUE) %&gt;%\n    mutate(miles.sqrt = sqrt(x = VALUE))\n\nNow, graph the variable with the 4 recommended transformations to see which is most normal (bell shaped).\n\n\ncuberoot &lt;- dist.mat.cleaned %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = miles.cube.root)) + geom_histogram(fill = \"#7463AC\",\n    color = \"white\") + theme_minimal() + labs(x = \"Cube root of miles to nearest facility\",\n    y = \"Number of counties\")\n\nlogged &lt;- dist.mat.cleaned %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = miles.log)) + geom_histogram(fill = \"#7463AC\", color = \"white\") +\n    theme_minimal() + labs(x = \"Log of miles to nearest facility\", y = \"\")\n\ninversed &lt;- dist.mat.cleaned %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = miles.inverse)) + geom_histogram(fill = \"#7463AC\", color = \"white\") +\n    theme_minimal() + xlim(0, 1) + labs(x = \"Inverse of miles to nearest facility\",\n    y = \"Number of counties\")\n\nsquareroot &lt;- dist.mat.cleaned %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = miles.sqrt)) + geom_histogram(fill = \"#7463AC\", color = \"white\") +\n    theme_minimal() + labs(x = \"Square root of miles to nearest facility\",\n    y = \"\")\n\n\nWe can show all 4 graphs at one time to directly compare. Ensure your plot window is large enough to see this.\n\n\ngridExtra::grid.arrange(cuberoot, logged, inversed, squareroot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, determine if any of the transformations help. In this example, we determined that the cuberoot had the most normal transformation. The cube root graph contains a nice bell shape curve.\nLet’s use that new variable in the analysis. Start by summarizing the descriptive statistics, including retrieving the mean and standard deviation for cube root of miles, which are values that are required in the probability calculations.\n\n\ndist.mat.cleaned %&gt;%\n    drop_na(miles.cube.root) %&gt;%\n    summarize(mean.tran.dist = mean(x = miles.cube.root), sd.tran.dist = sd(x = miles.cube.root))\n\n  mean.tran.dist sd.tran.dist\n1       2.662915    0.7923114\n\n\n\n2.66 and .79 are the values we pulled for mean and standard deviation. We can use that information to calculate probabilities based on the functions we mentioned above.\nSo, what happens if the cuberoot of X &lt; 3 or less than 27 miles from the facility?\nWe estimate that about 66% of counties fall in the shaded area, having to travel less than 27 miles to nearest facility (27 = 3^3).\nThis means that (1- 0.6665403)*100 is the percentage of countries having to travel more than 27 miles to the nearest facility.\n\n\n27^(1/3)\n\n[1] 3\n\n3^3\n\n[1] 27\n\n# P(X&lt; cuberoot(27) = P(X &lt; 3)\npnorm(3, 2.66, 0.79)  ##about 66% likely\n\n[1] 0.6665403\n\n# P(X &gt; 3) #about 33% likely\npnorm(3, 2.66, 0.79, lower.tail = FALSE)\n\n[1] 0.3334597\n\n1 - pnorm(3, 2.66, 0.79)\n\n[1] 0.3334597\n\n\n\nWe estimate that about 20% of counties fall in the shaded area, having to travel &lt; 8 miles to nearest facility (8 = 2^3).\n\n\npnorm(2, 2.66, 0.79)\n\n[1] 0.2017342\n\n\n\nWe can use the equation to calculate the z-score for a county where you have to drive 15 miles to a facility.\n\n\n## z = (x-m)/sd since we are in cube root - we multiply x by ^1/3\n(15^(1/3) - 2.66)/0.79\n\n[1] -0.2453012\n\n\n\nThe transformed distance of a facility 15 miles away is .24 standard deviations LOWER than the mean transformed distance.\nNext, we can calculate z for a county with residents who have to travel 50 miles to the nearest facility. In the transformed miles variable, this would be the cube root of 50, or a value of 3.68.\n\n\n(50^(1/3) - 2.66)/0.79  #[1] 1.296242\n\n[1] 1.296242\n\n\n\nThis indicated that the transformed distance to a facility with MAT for this example county was 1.29 standard deviations above the mean transformed distance from a county to a facility with MAT.\n\n\n3.4.1 Transformation Second Example\n\nTaking a second example, let us look at the PHYSHLTH variable from the gender dataset (brfss.csv). We worked with this dataset in an earlier lesson. In doing so, we cleaned the data.\nI copied over that data preparation code in regards to the variable of interest (PHYSHLTH), and tidied it up for one example. To remind ourselves, the question being asked was the following, “Now thinking about your physical health, which includes physical illness and injury, for how many days during the past 30 days was your physical health not good?”\nIf ever you are using the MASS package and dplyr, the select function may have a conflict where R does not know which to use. If you get an error when using select, add dplyr:: in front of the statement to ensure you are using select from dplyr to select variables.\n\n\n#\ngender &lt;- read.csv(\"data/brfss.csv\")\n# Review the data\nsummary(gender)\n\n    TRNSGNDR        X_AGEG5YR          X_RACE         X_INCOMG    \n Min.   :1.000    Min.   : 1.000   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :1.000  \n 1st Qu.:4.000    1st Qu.: 5.000   1st Qu.:1.000   1st Qu.:3.000  \n Median :4.000    Median : 8.000   Median :1.000   Median :5.000  \n Mean   :4.059    Mean   : 7.822   Mean   :1.992   Mean   :4.481  \n 3rd Qu.:4.000    3rd Qu.:10.000   3rd Qu.:1.000   3rd Qu.:5.000  \n Max.   :9.000    Max.   :14.000   Max.   :9.000   Max.   :9.000  \n NA's   :310602                    NA's   :94                     \n    X_EDUCAG        HLTHPLN1         HADMAM          X_AGE80     \n Min.   :1.000   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :1.000    Min.   :18.00  \n 1st Qu.:2.000   1st Qu.:1.000   1st Qu.:1.000    1st Qu.:44.00  \n Median :3.000   Median :1.000   Median :1.000    Median :58.00  \n Mean   :2.966   Mean   :1.108   Mean   :1.215    Mean   :55.49  \n 3rd Qu.:4.000   3rd Qu.:1.000   3rd Qu.:1.000    3rd Qu.:69.00  \n Max.   :9.000   Max.   :9.000   Max.   :9.000    Max.   :80.00  \n                                 NA's   :208322                  \n    PHYSHLTH   \n Min.   : 1.0  \n 1st Qu.:20.0  \n Median :88.0  \n Mean   :61.2  \n 3rd Qu.:88.0  \n Max.   :99.0  \n NA's   :4     \n\n# PHYSHLTH example\ngender.clean &lt;- gender %&gt;%\n    dplyr::select(PHYSHLTH) %&gt;%\n    drop_na() %&gt;%\n    # Turn the 77 values to NA, since 77 meant don't know or not sure\n    # from the brss codebook\nmutate(PHYSHLTH = na_if(PHYSHLTH, y = 77)) %&gt;%\n    # Turn the 99 values to NA, since 99 meant Refuled from the brss\n    # codebook.\nmutate(PHYSHLTH = na_if(PHYSHLTH, y = 99)) %&gt;%\n    # Recode the 88 values to 0 - since the number 88 meant 0 days of\n    # illness from the brss codebook.\nmutate(PHYSHLTH = recode(PHYSHLTH, `88` = 0L))\ntable(gender.clean$PHYSHLTH)\n\n\n     0      1      2      3      4      5      6      7      8      9     10 \n291696  19505  24890  14713   7644  12931   2140   8049   1478    325   9437 \n    11     12     13     14     15     16     17     18     19     20     21 \n   133    908     92   4558   8638    221    153    279     51   5554   1111 \n    22     23     24     25     26     27     28     29     30 \n   132     80     98   2270    149    204    831    390  35701 \n\nsummary(gender.clean)\n\n    PHYSHLTH     \n Min.   : 0.000  \n 1st Qu.: 0.000  \n Median : 0.000  \n Mean   : 4.224  \n 3rd Qu.: 3.000  \n Max.   :30.000  \n NA's   :10299   \n\nqnorm(0.95, mean = 500, sd = 10)\n\n[1] 516.4485\n\n\n\nOnce here, we graph PHYSHLTH.\n\n\n\ngender.clean %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(PHYSHLTH)) + geom_histogram(fill = \"#7463AC\", color = \"white\") +\n    theme_minimal() + labs(x = \"Number of Days Sick\", y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe determined from the descriptive statistics lesson that this variable had severe skewness (positive).

    "text": "5.1 Date data type\n\nThe date data type in R is used to represent calendar dates, allowing for accurate storage and manipulation of time-related data. Dates in R are typically stored as objects of class Date, which internally represent the number of days since January 1, 1970. This format facilitates arithmetic operations, such as calculating differences between dates or adding/subtracting days. Dates can be created and manipulated using functions like as.Date() for converting character strings to date objects, or Sys.Date() for retrieving the current date. Handling dates correctly is essential in time series analysis, scheduling, and any task involving chronological data, as improper formatting or assumptions can lead to errors in analysis.\n\n\n# Convert date info in format 'mm/dd/yyyy' using as.Date\nstrDates &lt;- c(\"01/05/1965\", \"08/16/1975\")\ndates &lt;- as.Date(strDates, \"%m/%d/%Y\")\nstr(dates)\n\n Date[1:2], format: \"1965-01-05\" \"1975-08-16\"\n\n\n\nThe lubridate package provides additional tools for working with dates, such as parsing and extracting components like year, month, and day.

For example, you can create and embed a plot using the ggplot2 package.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2) ggplot(mpg, aes(x=displ, y=hwy)) + geom_point()\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + geom_point()",

    "text": "6.6 Packages Required for RMD to Work\n\nRMarkdown requires updated packages for formatting and when saving as .pdf documents, a latex extension is also required so that it properly reads the formulas in the problems. Download the .R file on Blackboard and follow the instructions provided to use RMarkdown.\nThe R file includes the following commands:\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"rmarkdown\")\ninstall.packages(\"knitr\")\ninstall.packages(\"formatR\")\ntinytex::install_tinytex()  # Select Y when/if it asks down in the console.\n\n\nTo use RMarkdown most efficiently, make sure your version of R is the latest by checking the website. If it is not, then take the time to get the latest version of the software. Second, make sure your files are not on the cloud, including OneDrive. If so, then decouple at least your desktop with OneDrive so you can work off the cloud. Finally, run the lines below one at a time. Once the packages are done installing, then restart your computer. Finally, open RStudio and run a blank RMarkdown file. If this file knits, then your homework should knit as long as there are no other errors.\nYou may only need to update one of these packages. However, since they are all connected, running these commands ensures that they are all up to date with minimal troubleshooting.",

    "text": "6.7 Troubleshooting RMD FIles\n\nLack of Syntax Errors:\n\nR Markdown files may fail to knit without providing clear syntax error messages.\nTo troubleshoot, run each code chunk interactively in RStudio to identify and fix errors before knitting.\nPay attention to any warnings or messages in the console as they may indicate potential issues.\n\nUsing Relative Links to Datasets:\n\nIf the .Rmd file relies on external datasets, ensure that file paths are specified using relative links.\nRelative links ensure portability, allowing the .Rmd file to work on different systems without modification.\nFor example, if a dataset is in a subfolder, use a path like data &lt;- read.csv(“data/my_dataset.csv”).\nAlways verify that the dataset exists in the specified location relative to the working directory.\n\nIncluding Necessary Libraries:\n\nFunctions from external libraries will fail if the required libraries are not loaded.\nAt the beginning of the .Rmd file, load all necessary libraries explicitly using library() calls, e.g., library(tidyverse).\nEnsure that all libraries used in the document are installed beforehand by running install.packages() if needed.\nLoading libraries early prevents errors during knitting and avoids confusing error messages.",
